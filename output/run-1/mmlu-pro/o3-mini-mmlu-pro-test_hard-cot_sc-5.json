After absorption by enterocytes, they are reesterified into triglycerides.

        "question": "A 16-year-old high school student, whose prenatal course you have managed, delivers a 3256-g (7-lb 3-oz) baby girl during the night with the assistance of your associate. On morning rounds you note that the delivery records report that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. Today blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, she is afebrile, and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and her perineum is slightly edematous. Hematocrit is 33%. She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. Which of the following is the most important next step in management?",

Her vital signs are within acceptable limits, her uterine fundus is firm (indicating good uterine contraction), the blood loss of 500 mL is acceptable especially in a vaginal delivery, and she is bonding normally with her infant. There is no evidence of postpartum hemorrhage, severe hypertension, or infection that would require other interventions. Therefore, the next most important step is to provide education regarding well-baby care (option J), ensuring that she has the support and information needed to care for her newborn.\n\nJ",

Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22\u2013 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?",

            "A": "The patient is not a carrier of the DMD as her muscle creatine kinase concentration is within the normal range",

The absence of genetic analysis on her affected relatives leaves ambiguity regarding the exact mutation present, and while the mother\u2019s biochemical testing supports carrier status, it does not definitively predict transmission to her daughter. \n\nThus, the most reliable answer, based on the provided solutions, is D. \n\nAnswer: D",
