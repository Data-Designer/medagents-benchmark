Vital signs are temperature 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated.

She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks?\"",

        "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22\u2013 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?",

            "C": "The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD",
