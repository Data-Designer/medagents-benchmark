They were also tested for bilateral and unilateral leg extensor muscle concentric power output by an isokinetic squat and reactive strength by a drop jump.\nThe correlations between concentric power and straight sprinting speed were non-significant whereas the relationships between reactive strength and straight speed were statistically significant. Correlations between muscle power and speed while changing direction were generally low and non-significant for concentric leg power with some moderate and significant (p<0.05) coefficients found for reactive strength. The participants who turned faster to one side tended to have a reactive strength dominance in the leg responsible for the push-off action.\nIs muscle power related to running speed with changes of direction?",

An early newborn discharge was defined as a discharge between 24 and 47 hours of age. Metabolic screening tests included phenylketonuria (PKU), hypothyroidism, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Early discharge and traditional stay infants were compared to determine the percentage of newborns screened and the timing of the first adequate specimen.\nThe state laboratory received specimens from 3860 infants; 1324 were on early discharge newborns and 2536 infants in the traditional stay group. At least one filter paper test (PKU, hypothyroidism, and CAH) was collected on 99.2% of early discharge infants and 96.0% of traditional stay infants (P<.0001). Early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate (22.9%) compared with traditional stay infants (14.3%, P<.0001) but had a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate (85.0% early discharge vs 75.3% traditional stay, P=.002). The early discharge group was more likely to have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life (1001, 98.8% early discharge vs 2016, 96.7% traditional stay, P=.0005).\nDoes early discharge with nurse home visits affect adequacy of newborn metabolic screening?",

For combined readings, results were considered positive if either of the two interpreters reported finding a polyp or carcinoma. A McNemar test was used to compare the first reader's results with the combined results of the first and second readers. Results were retrospectively correlated with endoscopic or surgical results in 360 patients, and agreement between first and combined readings and endoscopic results was determined.\nAdding a second reader increased the number of positive results on examinations from 249 to 315 (p<0.0001) and resulted in potential alteration of clinical treatment in 98 patients (9.9%). Sensitivity of the first and combined readings for detection of all lesions was identical, 76.3% (95% CI, 65.4-87.1%).

Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor. A 2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, as well as logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the collected data with confidence interval higher than 95%.\nOverall scores were similar.

Kidney damage markers (daily proteinuria and tubular enzymes) and renal function (serum creatinine, cystatin C, and creatinine clearances) were assessed on postoperative days 1 and 5 and at 12 mo. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was evaluated before surgery and at 3 mo. Renal scintigraphy was performed before the procedure, at 5 d and at 3 and 12 mo postoperatively.

        "question": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006).\nMidwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?",

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1.\nDoes the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?",

        "question": "Assessing the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients consists of periodical clinical evaluations and laboratory tests. We aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in IBD patients.\nNinety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were tested using the log-rank test.\nThe calprotectin test was positive in 44 UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02).\nCan calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease?",

This study was developed as part of a formative evaluation of HSKs.\nFocus groups and one-to-one semi-structured interviews with MSM were conducted. Focus group participants (n = 20) were shown a variety of self-sampling materials and asked to discuss them. Individual interviewees (n = 24) had experience of the self-sampling techniques as part of a pilot clinical study. All data were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a framework analysis approach.\nThe concept of a HSK was generally viewed as positive, with many benefits identified relating to increased access to testing, enhanced personal comfort and empowerment.

The answers were based on clear evidence from the studies presented. In this case, we need to assess whether the evidence provided supports a causative link between the two conditions.\n\n2. **Analyze the case details**: The case describes a seven-year-old girl with a history of infantile encephalopathy and recurrent infections, who presented with symptoms leading to a diagnosis of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis. The child also has a probable Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. The positive tuberculin test and culture confirming the presence of Koch bacillus (the bacterium that causes tuberculosis) indicate an active infection. However, the case does not provide direct evidence that Say-Barber-Miller syndrome causes or is linked to the development of tuberculosis.\n\n3. **Compare and eliminate incorrect choices**:\n   - **Option A (yes)**: This would imply a confirmed causative link, which is not established in the case. The evidence does not directly support that Say-Barber-Miller syndrome causes tuberculosis.\n   - **Option B (no)**: This would imply that there is no link at all, which may not be entirely accurate since the case suggests a possible association but does not confirm it.\n   - **Option C (maybe)**: This option allows for the possibility of a link without asserting it definitively. Given that the case discusses a \"putative causative link\" but does not provide conclusive evidence, this option seems the most appropriate.\n\n4. **Provide the final answer**: Based on the analysis, the most suitable answer is that there may be a link, but it is not definitively established.

The risk of recurrent stroke increases substantially with age, as does the potential benefit of secondary prevention. In order to develop effective strategies for older patients, it is important to identify how stroke care is currently provided for this patient group.\nBetween 2004 and 2006, older patients (>75 years) referred to a neurovascular clinic were compared with younger patients (<or =75 years). Sociodemographic details, clinical features, resource use and secondary prevention in a neurovascular clinic were collected.\nOf 379 patients referred to the clinic, 129 (34%) were given a non-stroke diagnosis. Of the remaining 250 patients, 149 (60%) were<or =75 years. Median time from symptom onset to clinic appointment was similar for the two groups (24 (IQR 15-42) vs 24 (IQR 14-43) days; p = 0.58). Older patients were more likely to be in atrial fibrillation (10.1% vs 22.8%, p<0.001) and have lacunar stroke (34.7% vs 22.1%; p = 0.04). CT rates were similar in the two groups (27.8% vs 80.0%, p = 0.75). Scans were performed more quickly in younger patients (p<0.01).

Yet many clinicians are concerned about overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and community providers.\nWe developed a survey to measure decision-making in two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.\nExperts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001).

We decided to study the temperature levels during preservation with the Biotainer storage can and Vitalpack transport pack.\nTemperature was monitored using the Thermobouton probe during preservation of pig kidneys, in the same conditions used with human grafts. The probe recorded the temperature level every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from August 2007 to May 2008.\nThe temperature levels were the same regardless of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes.

Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.

Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.\nNine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold.\nDoes combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients?",

        "question": "The aim of this work is to assess a previously described slit-lamp biomicroscopy-based method (SLBM) for measuring pupil diameter and compare it to Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP).\nTwo examiners performed three repeated measurements with each instrument in 40 healthy eyes. We determined the agreement of SLBM and CIP, intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities, and interobserver concordance (kappa) and SLBM ability for detecting pupil sizes over 6.0\u00a0mm.\nThe mean (\u00b1standard deviation [SD]) pupil diameter was 5.81 \u00b1 0.70\u00a0mm with SLBM and 6.26 \u00b1 0.68\u00a0mm with CIP (p\u2009=\u20090.01) averaging both examiner's results. Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60\u00a0mm and -0.30\u00a0mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30\u00a0mm. The ICCs were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP. Interobserver reproducibility: the width of the LoA ranged from 1.82 to 2.09\u00a0mm. Kappa statistics were 0.39 and 0.49 for the first and mean SLBM readings, respectively, and 0.45 for both the first and mean CIP readings. Sensitivity and specificity of SLBM for detection of pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm ranged from 55.56% to 73.68% and from 76.19% to 95.45%, respectively. The best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity ranged from 5.4\u00a0mm to 6.2\u00a0mm.\nCan we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method?",
        "answer": "no",
        "answer_rationale": "Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6\u00a0mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease.\nThe prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment.\nCoronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01).

The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.\nA total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively.

        "question": "Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%.\nAre women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?",

The goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth.\nThis audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance against 4 standards: (1) Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor to all patients; (2) Acceptance and good satisfaction level reported by patients and caregivers. (3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side effects.\nDuring the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p<0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 8.5\u00b11.4 before to 4.1\u00b11.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) VAS decreased from 8.12\u00b11.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76\u00b10.79 after (p<0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after).

Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk.\nData from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression.\nOne thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10).

Additionally, improvement was significantly more frequent in those who had changed jobs compared to those who had not.\n\n2. **Comparing Options**:\n   - **A. yes**: This option suggests that the prognosis is dependent on the omnipresence of the allergen. Given that the clearance rates were different between ubiquitous and nonubiquitous allergens, this option seems plausible.\n   - **B. no**: This option would imply that the omnipresence of the allergen does not affect the prognosis. However, the data indicates a trend where nonubiquitous allergens had better outcomes, which contradicts this option.\n   - **C. maybe**: This option suggests uncertainty. While there is some variability in the data, the significant difference in clearance rates between the two groups leans more towards a definitive conclusion rather than uncertainty.\n\n3. **Final Decision**: The evidence suggests that the prognosis for patients with allergic contact dermatitis is indeed influenced by whether the allergen is ubiquitous or nonubiquitous. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nA. yes\n\nFinal answer: [A]"

Correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness, which was measured by echocardiography and serum paraoxonase 1 level. Also correlation analysis was performed to show correlation between patients' clinical and laboratory findings and the level of serum paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) and the epicardial fat tissue thickness. Pearson and Spearman test were used for correlation analysis.\nNo linear correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness and serum PON 1 found (correlation coefficient: -0.127, p=0.069). When epicardial fat tissue thickness were grouped as 7 mm and over, and below, and 5 mm and over, and below, serum PON 1 level were significantly lower in \u22657 mm group (PON1 : 168.9 U/L) than<7 mm group (PON 1: 253.9 U/L) (p<0.001).

Pharmacy sales of over-the-counter (OTC) syringes have helped prevent HIV transmission among injection drug users in many states throughout the United States. However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between OTC syringe sales and crime.\nWe used a geographic information system and novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts. We assessed reported crime pre- and post-OTC syringe sales initiation as well as longitudinal associations between crime and OTC syringe-selling pharmacies.\nBy December 2008, 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy. Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased between 2006 and 2008 in all 1010 Reporting Districts.

Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition.

It highlights that among middle-aged individuals who reported financial difficulties, the utilization of eye care providers was significantly lower (28.1%) compared to those without financial difficulties (41.9%). The prevalence ratio of 0.68 indicates that those with financial difficulties are less likely to utilize eye care services, even after adjusting for age, sex, and education.\n\n2. **Comparison of Options**:\n   - **A. yes**: This would imply that government assistance does improve utilization of eye care services.\n   - **B. no**: This would suggest that government assistance does not improve utilization.\n   - **C. maybe**: This indicates uncertainty or lack of clear evidence.\n\n3. **Elimination of Incorrect Choices**: The data shows that individuals with financial difficulties utilize eye care services less than those without. This suggests that the current government assistance is not sufficient to improve utilization rates among low-income individuals. Therefore, we can eliminate option A, as the evidence does not support that government assistance improves utilization.\n\nGiven the evidence presented, the most accurate conclusion is that government assistance does not improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals.\n\nFinal answer: [B]"

The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion.\nIn this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used.\nThe sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 \u00b1 6.74 years.

The primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire.\nWe performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (\u226560 years) in Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at \u226575%. Knowledge of stroke and clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression.\nAmong 367 elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%). On average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time. Compared to lower levels of education, higher levels were associated to correctly endorsed intention to call 911 (secondary School adjusted OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86 and Tertiary/University adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.12-8.21).\nDo elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke?",

        "question": "Although the Internet is commonly used to recruit samples in studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors, it has not been used to measure patient-reported well-being. As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions.\nThis study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden.\nThe Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis.\nThe Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21-0.49, P<.001).\nDo Web-based and clinic samples of gay men living with HIV differ on self-reported physical and psychological symptoms?",

        "question": "Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up.\nTreatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?",

Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.",

        "question": "Although dose-volume parameters in image-guided brachytherapy have become a standard, the use of posterior-inferior border of the pubic symphysis (PIBS) points has been recently proposed in the reporting of vaginal doses. The aim was to evaluate their pertinence.\nNineteen patients who received image-guided brachytherapy after concurrent radiochemotherapy were included. Per treatment, CT scans were performed at Days 2 and 3, with reporting of the initial dwell positions and times. Doses delivered to the PIBS points were evaluated on each plan, considering that they were representative of one-third of the treatment. The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were analysed.\nMean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, respectively, 2.23 \u00b1 1.4, 6.39 \u00b1 6.6, and 31.85 \u00b1 36.06 Gy. Significant differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered dose was decreased by 1.43 \u00b1 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019). The delivered doses at the four points were strongly correlated with the prescribed doses with R(2) ranging from 0.93 to 0.95.

This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.\nWe investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor.

The primary endpoint of the study was the 12-month major adverse cardiovascular event rate, consisting of death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.\nCompared with patients without, those with 1 or more HBR criteria had worse outcomes, owing to higher ischemic and bleeding risks.

In this case, we are examining the relationship between arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus.\n\n2. **Analyze the data provided**: The study found a slightly elevated risk of diabetes mellitus among glassworks employees, with specific odds ratios indicating a potential association. The odds ratios suggest that there is a higher risk of diabetes among those potentially exposed to arsenic, particularly in certain groups (like unspecified glass workers).\n\n3. **Compare and eliminate incorrect choices**:\n   - **Option A (yes)**: This suggests a clear association, which is supported by the data showing elevated odds ratios for diabetes among those exposed to arsenic.\n   - **Option B (no)**: This would imply that there is no association, which contradicts the findings of elevated risk.\n   - **Option C (maybe)**: This suggests uncertainty, but the data does indicate a potential association, making this option less appropriate.\n\n4. **Provide the final answer**: Given the evidence of elevated risk and the context of the study, the most appropriate conclusion is that there is an association between occupational arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers.\n\nFinal answer: [A]"

Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography.\nWe retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression.\nWe identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%.

            "To determine whether the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension identifies cognitive impairments, let's analyze the information provided in the study.\n\n1. **Relevant Information**: The study assessed the relationship between the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale and various cognitive measures in individuals with brain tumors. The findings indicated that the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale was not related to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or age. However, it was significantly related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and subjective complaints of memory problems.\n\n2. **Comparison of Options**:\n   - **A. yes**: This would imply that the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension is effective in identifying cognitive impairments. However, the study specifically states that it was not related to objective cognitive measures, which contradicts this option.\n   - **B. no**: This option suggests that the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not identify cognitive impairments. Given that the obsessive-compulsive subscale was not related to objective cognitive measures, this option aligns with the findings.\n   - **C. maybe**: This option implies uncertainty. However, the data provided is clear in showing that the obsessive-compulsive dimension does not correlate with cognitive impairments, making this option less appropriate.\n\n3. **Final Decision**: Based on the analysis, the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not identify cognitive impairments as it was not related to objective cognitive measures.\n\nFinal answer: [B]",
            "To determine whether the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension identifies cognitive impairments, let's analyze the information provided in the new question step by step.\n\n1. **Relevant Information**: The study assessed the relationship between the SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive subscale and various cognitive measures in individuals with brain tumors.

However, the study found no relationship with objective cognitive measures, which suggests it does not identify cognitive impairments.\n   - **B. no**: This option suggests that the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension does not identify cognitive impairments, which aligns with the study's findings that it was not related to objective cognitive measures.\n   - **C. maybe**: This option implies uncertainty. However, the data provided is clear in showing that the obsessive-compulsive dimension does not correlate with cognitive impairments.\n\n3. **Elimination of Incorrect Choices**: Based on the analysis, option A can be eliminated because the SCL 90-R did not correlate with cognitive measures. Option C can also be eliminated as the findings are definitive rather than uncertain.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the final answer is: [B]",
