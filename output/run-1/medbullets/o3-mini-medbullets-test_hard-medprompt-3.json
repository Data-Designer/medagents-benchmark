He states the pain is constant and is primarily located on his right side. When asked to indicate the area of pain, he says that it surrounds his eye and upper forehead. He had one episode of vomiting. The patient also reports difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which he attributes to excessive tearing.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden-onset unilateral vision loss and an orbitofrontal headache with a dilated pupil and a hard ocular globe suggesting a diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Long-term management of angle-closure glaucoma can include acetazolamide.\n\nExamination of the eye in a patient with acute-closure glaucoma will reveal a red eye that is rock-hard and a mid-dilated pupil which is minimally reactive to light. The fundoscopic exam will show an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio (>0.4) and tonometry will show increased intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Acute treatment and long-term management involve the administration of beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide to decrease intraocular pressure. The definitive treatment is iridotomy.\n\nAiraksinen et al. review the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. They discuss how a combination of acetazolamide and beta-blockers can terminate an attack. They recommend using 1 drop of pilocarpine 3 hours after intravenous acetazolamide administration.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing an eye with injected conjunctiva (red circles) and a mid-dilated pupil. These findings are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Amitriptyline can be used as prophylaxis for migraines. Migraines present as unilateral, pulsating headaches that may be associated with nausea or photophobia. Patients with migraines can sometimes experience an aura with visual field changes; however, they would not have exam findings of a rock-hard eye or injection.\n\nAnswer C: Clopidogrel may be used as a conservative treatment for carotid atherosclerosis, which can be an embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO presents as acute, painless, monocular vision loss. A fundoscopic exam will demonstrate ischemia of the retina.\n\nAnswer D: Epinephrine is contraindicated in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma as it increases pupillary dilation. It is used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. This would present with gradually patchy loss of vision and is generally painless.\n\nAnswer E: Verapamil is used as prophylaxis for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches present as unilateral, repetitive, brief headaches associated with severe peri-orbital pain, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPharmacologic management of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",

Typically, this is a parent feigning or creating symptoms in a child in order to receive the psychiatric gain of attention from healthcare personnel.

Gastroenteritis does not best explain the most likely underlying cause of this patient's presentation.\n\nAnswer B: Immunodeficiency such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) would present with lifelong infections from birth that are bacterial, viral, and fungal. Immunodeficiency would not present with repeat infections in a pediatric patient only when they are with one patient.\n\nAnswer D: Meningitis would present with headache, altered mental status, and meningeal signs. In the setting of repeat sepsis in a healthy pediatric patient, intentional contamination is more likely. Similarly, an absence of photophobia and no further history/physical exam supporting this diagnosis suggests an alternative diagnosis.\n\nAnswer E: Urinary tract infection would present with dysuria rather than repeat episodes of sepsis.

            "Let's review the important findings:\n\n\u2022 The patient is a 9\u2010year\u2010old girl with a history of recent infections. She was treated 6 weeks ago for an Escherichia coli infection and 10 weeks ago for a urinary tract infection.\n\n\u2022 Her current presentation includes fever, altered mental status, severe headache, stiff neck, vomiting, and dark cloudy urine. The neurologic findings (headache, stiff neck, and decreased responsiveness) suggest central nervous system involvement (meningitis) along with evidence of ongoing urinary tract infection and sepsis.\n\n\u2022 An important social clue is that her father notes she \u201cdoes not seem to get sick when he takes care of her.\u201d Given that the parents are divorced, this discrepancy between caregivers raises concern.\n\n\u2022 In a child who is otherwise developmentally normal, up\u2010to\u2010date on vaccinations, and without a history of recurrent infections early in life, repeated infections with the same organisms (E. coli in this case) are unusual. When a child presents with repeated infections under the care of one caregiver but not the other, one must consider the possibility of intentional contamination of the child\u2014a scenario consistent with Munchausen syndrome by proxy.\n\nNow let\u2019s examine the options:\nA. Gastroenteritis \u2013 Does not explain the neurologic signs, recurrent UTIs, or the social context.\nB. Immunodeficiency \u2013 Although recurrent infections might suggest this, the child\u2019s normal early history and up\u2010to\u2010date vaccinations make this less likely. Also, the discrepancy between caregivers is not explained by an immunodeficiency.\nC. Intentional contamination \u2013 Given the repeated similar infections and the observation that she is well cared for by her father, this raises the possibility that one parent (likely the mother) may be deliberately contaminating her. This fits with a pattern seen in Munchausen syndrome by proxy.\nD. Meningitis \u2013 While her symptoms suggest a potential meningitis (possibly as a part of sepsis), this is a manifestation of her current presentation rather than an underlying explanation.\nE. Urinary tract infection \u2013 Although she has had UTIs, this would not explain the recurrent pattern and the social discrepancy noted between caregivers.\n\nThus, when considering the recurrence of infections specifically under one caregiver and the pattern of these illnesses, the most appropriate underlying explanation is intentional contamination by the caregiver.\n\nFinal answer: C. Intentional contamination.",
            "Step 1: Analyze the case details. This 9-year-old girl presents with fever, changes in behavior, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, and dark cloudy urine. Her condition has acutely worsened, leading to shock (low blood pressure, high pulse) despite therapy started for sepsis with intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics.\n\nStep 2: Review the pertinent history. Notice that she had similar episodes of illness in the recent past:\n\u2022 Treated for an E. coli infection 6 weeks ago.\n\u2022 Treated for a urinary tract infection 10 weeks ago.\n\u2022 Importantly, her father reports that she does not usually get sick when she is under his care, suggesting that her episodes of illness are not a result of an inherent disease process.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the answer options:\nA. Gastroenteritis \u2013 The clinical features (meningeal signs, shock, and dark cloudy urine) do not align with a simple gastrointestinal infection.\nB. Immunodeficiency \u2013 The patient is up to date on her vaccinations, reached developmental milestones, and does not have recurrent infections outside of these episodes, making this unlikely.\nC. Intentional contamination \u2013 This points toward caregiver-induced illness, such as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, particularly as the illness episodes occur only when the mother is in charge.\nD. Meningitis \u2013 Although she does exhibit meningeal signs (headache and stiff neck), the concurrent presence of dark cloudy urine and the history of repeated infections only in one setting make meningitis alone an incomplete explanation.\nE. Urinary tract infection \u2013 While she has a history of UTIs and dark cloudy urine, the presence of central nervous system symptoms (headache, stiff neck, altered mental status) is not explained solely by a UTI.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion. Given that her illnesses occur in a specific caregiving context (when her mother is present) and her symptoms have been induced repeatedly in a suspicious pattern without an underlying immunological or infectious predisposition, the most appropriate explanation is intentional contamination (caregiver-induced illness).\n\nFinal Answer: C.

The patient\u2019s ECG reveals deep, pathologic Q waves, which in this case are an incidental finding indicative of a previous myocardial infarction or a previous ischemic event.\n\nThe Q wave is a negative deflection just prior to the R wave. Q waves are a normal finding when they are small and are seen on most ECGs. However, pathologic Q waves are indicative of myocardial ischemia. Pathologic Q waves are generally diagnosed when they are >2 mm deep, >1 mm wide, >25% of the QRS complex height, or are seen in leads V1-V3. The interpretation of Q waves depends on other findings on ECG and the patient's symptoms. Deep Q waves in the setting of ST elevation indicate an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, pathologic Q waves found incidentally indicate a previous myocardial infarction or previous ischemic event.\n\nRovai et al. review Q waves. They discuss how Q waves can be used to predict the location and size of a myocardial infarction as correlated with MRI. They recommend testing such as cardiac MRI to assess for previous infarction in the appropriate patient population.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating pathologic Q waves (red arrows). Note the deep and wide Q waves; this raises concern for a past ischemic event.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute myocardial infarctions would present with ST elevation in a vascular distribution on ECG with possible reciprocal depressions. While T wave inversions may be indicative of new or acute ischemia, deep pathologic Q waves without ST elevation are indicative of previous infarction.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia would cause U waves on ECG, which appear as a small, \"second T wave\" after the initial T wave. Note they are not U-shaped despite their name. Management is centered on repletion of potassium and often magnesium as well.\n\nAnswer C: Intermittent torsades de pointes can cause syncope and should be suspected in a patient with syncope in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. This patient\u2019s QT interval is not particularly prolonged, and his syncope seems to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Management is centered on cessation of QT-prolonging medications and magnesium administration. Note that while ondansetron does prolong the QT interval, it is unlikely to cause torsades given the patient took it a week ago.\n\nAnswer E: Pulmonary emboli would present on ECG with sinus tachycardia in addition to pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia. Note that the ECG is a nonspecific test for pulmonary emboli, and CT angiography is the preferred confirmatory test for this condition. Syncope is a possible presentation of larger pulmonary emboli (though the patient would also be hemodynamically unstable).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPathologic Q waves are indicative of a previous myocardial infarction.",

        "reason": "This patient presents following a motor vehicle accident with a tender abdomen and stable vital signs. Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding. This stable patient with a benign exam can undergo a CT scan, which will offer more data than a FAST exam and would be performed regardless of whether a FAST exam was positive or negative given this patient's intoxication and abdominal bruising.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn a patient who has experienced blunt abdominal trauma the most appropriate initial step in a stable patient is an abdominal CT scan.",

Notably, he has bruising over his abdomen, which raises concern for occult intra-abdominal injury despite a benign abdominal exam.\n\nStep 2: In trauma, the initial evaluation of stable patients with signs of blunt abdominal trauma often involves a focused, noninvasive, rapid assessment such as a FAST exam (Focused Abdominal Sonography for Trauma) to identify any free fluid which may indicate internal bleeding. A CT scan, while more detailed, is usually reserved for cases where the FAST exam is positive or the patient has other indications, especially given considerations like potential intoxication and limited resources in a rural setting.\n\nStep 3: The other options are less appropriate.

It most commonly occurs weeks to months after the MI, but can also occur within 1 week from an MI in rare cases. It is believed to result from an autoimmune reaction that occurs after damage to the heart (surgery and MI). It presents with chest pain, fever, pleuritic pain, and a pericardial friction rub. ECG demonstrates diffuse ST elevation with PR depression consistent with pericarditis. The most appropriate initial step in the management of this condition is symptomatic management with aspirin.\n\nLeib et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Dressler syndrome.

Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk. Patients will also develop bilateral cataracts if the deficit is not detected in the first few weeks after birth. Avoiding galactose by changing to a soy-based formula will avoid the complications of this disorder.\n\nTurck discusses using soy protein for infant feeding. The author notes that there are safety concerns with regards to the high phyto-estrogenic isoflavone content of these formulas. The author recommends that despite these safety concerns, these formulas should still be used in patients with classic galactosemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods would be effective in the treatment of hereditary fructose intolerance. This disease presents similarly to classic galactosemia, but cataracts would not be seen in patients with this disease.\n\nAnswer C: Providing imiglucerase enzyme replacement would be effective in the treatment of patients with Gaucher disease, which can also present with failure to thrive.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with acute acetaminophen intoxication. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance. This is no longer a preferred method of managing toxicities as patients can aspirate the vomitus or the toxic substance can induce more tissue damage during vomiting. In general, syrup of ipecac is the wrong answer choice for all toxicity cases.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAcetaminophen toxicity should be treated immediately with N-acetyl cysteine followed by further diagnostic workup including serum acetaminophen levels.",

        "reason": "This patient's non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, alkaline urine, and history of a calcium phosphate kidney stone and rheumatoid arthritis are suggestive of type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis. The treatment of choice is alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate).\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis results from impaired acid (H+) secretion in the distal nephron. Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis. They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case. The patient's muscle weakness is more suggestive of hypokalemia secondary to type 1 renal tubular acidosis. She does not report symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (joint pain/stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with use).\n\nBullet Summary:\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis is treated with alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate).",

While sodium bicarbonate can correct metabolic acidosis, the immediate concern is the hypokalemia, which is causing her muscle weakness.\n\u2022 The best next step is to begin potassium replacement therapy.

His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy. The authors recommend the use of endoscopic ultrasound in securing the diagnosis in patients with equivocal imaging findings and a high index of suspicion, such as patients with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating calcifications and chronic inflammatory injury (red arrows) suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone is the appropriate management of infectious diarrhea from a bacterial organism.

In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected. This patient\u2019s diarrhea is likely caused by his chronic pancreatitis; thus, oral rehydration may be indicated but does not address the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Rifaximin is an antibiotic that targets gut flora and can decrease enteric flora and treat conditions such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth presents in patients with conditions such as diabetic gastroparesis or scleroderma secondary to decreased bowel motility causing bacterial overgrowth and profuse diarrhea.

This insufficiency leads to inadequate pancreatic enzyme secretion, malabsorption of fats (leading to steatorrhea), and downstream complications such as vitamin D deficiency and hypocalcemia.\n\nStep 3: Choose the treatment that addresses the underlying cause.  \nThe mainstay of therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency secondary to chronic pancreatitis is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. These enzyme supplements help digest fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, thereby alleviating malabsorption symptoms and correcting nutritional deficiencies.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the answer options.  \nNone of the provided options (A. Ciprofloxacin, B. Loperamide, C. Oral rehydration, D. Pantoprazole, E. Rifaximin) correspond to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.  \n\u2022 Ciprofloxacin is used for bacterial infections.  \n\u2022 Loperamide is an antidiarrheal that would only offer symptomatic relief.  \n\u2022 Oral rehydration addresses dehydration rather than the underlying malabsorption.  \n\u2022 Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used for acid-related disorders.  \n\u2022 Rifaximin is an antibiotic used in conditions like irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea or small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), not for pancreatic enzyme deficiency.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion  \nAlthough the correct treatment for the underlying cause is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, this option is not listed among the answers. Nonetheless, based on the patient\u2019s presentation and pathophysiology, the most appropriate treatment is pancreatic enzyme supplementation.\n\nFinal Answer: Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the appropriate treatment for this patient\u2019s chronic pancreatitis and resultant pancreatic insufficiency."

Although his symptoms indicate brachial plexus involvement, the significant risk factors point toward a specific cause such as an apical lung tumor causing it.\n\n\u2022 Cerebral infarction \u2013 A stroke typically causes sudden onset, often with accompanying facial weakness and other signs, plus a different distribution of neurologic deficits. His symptoms have been progressive over weeks, making stroke less likely.\n\n\u2022 Scalenus anticus syndrome \u2013 Typically involves compression of the brachial plexus by the scalenus anticus muscle and is often reproducible with positional changes.

His symptoms have been present for weeks and have acutely worsened today.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the answer options using these details.\n\n\u2022 Option A (Apical lung tumor): A Pancoast tumor is an apical lung tumor that commonly occurs in smokers and often presents with symptoms of a brachial plexopathy (pain, weakness, and sensory deficits in the arm). Weight loss is also a concerning sign.\n\n\u2022 Option B (Brachial plexopathy): While the patient's symptoms do show signs of a brachial plexus issue, the context (significant smoking history and recent weight loss) makes a Pancoast tumor (an apical lung tumor causing plexopathy) more likely than a primary brachial plexopathy without a clear underlying cause.\n\n\u2022 Option C (Cerebral infarction): A stroke would more often produce additional neurological deficits (e.g., facial weakness, speech disturbances) and does not typically present with isolated arm weakness that is slowly progressive over weeks.\n\n\u2022 Option D (Scalenus anticus syndrome): Typically, symptoms might change with head and neck position. In this case, the patient stated there was no change with head or neck position.\n\n\u2022 Option E (Subclavian steal syndrome): This would generally be associated with differences in blood pressure between arms and transient neurological symptoms related to vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which is not consistent with this presentation.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion.

It typically occurs in a patient with a history of sinusitis, oral contraceptive pill usage, smoking, or other risk factors that could cause a hypercoagulable state. These patients will often present with severe pain, a sudden headache, and diplopia. A distinct appearance is typically noted with periorbital edema. These patients should be immediately treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and undergo surgical drainage of the inciting source of infection.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with bright red blood per rectum with a non-tender abdomen. Of the answer choices given, angiodysplasia is the most likely to cause such profuse and sudden bleeding.\n\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly in the colon. The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding. Any patient who is unstable or anemic with a hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL requires a transfusion with blood products. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of bright red blood per rectum but is not more common than diverticulosis.\n\nGarcia-Compeon et al. review the presentation and treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. The authors note that angiodysplasias are the cause of many \"occult\" GI bleeds not visualized on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. The authors recommend the use of capsule endoscopy in occult GI bleeds to identify angiodysplasias as a potential source.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Erosion into a gastric vessel is the pathophysiology of a bleeding gastric vessel secondary to peptic ulcer disease. This usually presents with melena (black tarry stools) rather than bright red blood per rectum. Only in cases of extremely brisk upper GI bleeding would patients present with bright red blood per rectum. Treatment involves treating Helicobacter pylori infection if present, proton pump inhibitors, and sucralfate. Endoscopy is needed to confirm and treat the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching is the pathophysiology of diverticulitis which presents with a history of constipation with a fever and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Management involves a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and administration of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or ceftriaxone and metronidazole). Diverticulosis presents with bright red blood and is possible in this patient, but it does not involve inflammation or infection, which defines diverticulitis.\n\nAnswer C: Malignancy or colon cancer can present with bright red blood per rectum, malaise, weight loss, and microcytic anemia. While it is possible in this patient, his age, lack of risk factors for colon cancer, and the sudden onset of his symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.\n\nAnswer D: Submucosal esophageal (Mallory-Weiss) tear presents after profuse vomiting (as in this patient) with bloody vomitus.

Empiric IV antibiotic therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam is the most appropriate initial management.\n\nPasteurella multocida is a gram-negative rod that is associated with cat and dog bites. Infection can lead to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Treatment of minor infection is with amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, patients suspected of having osteomyelitis should be treated empirically with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and sulbactam) and taken for biopsy/culture to identify the pathogen. Antibiotics can then be narrowed down accordingly. Patients will often require between 4-8 weeks of antibiotic treatment.

He discusses how Pasteurella multocida is a common complication of animal bites. He recommends early effective antibiotic treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answer:\nAnswer A: Amoxicillin and clavulanate can be used to treat Pasteurella infection. Patients with osteomyelitis should not be treated with oral antibiotics initially, in particular, when there are systemic manifestations as is present in this patient.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with symptoms of heart failure (CHF). The most likely laboratory abnormalities are elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), low sodium, and low potassium.\n\nHeart failure is characterized by the decreased performance of the cardiac ventricles resulting in ventricular dilation. As the ventricles dilate, they release BNP as a marker of stretching of myocardial tissue. BNP levels can therefore serve as a marker of CHF. The kidneys will also have decreased perfusion levels in this disease leading to several key physiologic changes. First, is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which serves to increase perfusion to the kidneys by increasing blood pressure. This system achieves increased blood pressure by maintaining sodium and fluid retention at the expense of decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and decreased hydronium ions (metabolic alkalosis). In addition, ADH is also increased to further increase perfusion, resulting in water retention, hemodilution, and hyponatremia.\n\nMa et al. studied the correlation between BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes. They found that patients with CHF and high levels of BNP had increased rates of cardiovascular complications. They recommend assessing BNP levels in patients who are suspected of having CHF.\n\nFigure A is a chart with changes in brain natriuretic peptide, anti-diuretic hormone, sodium, and potassium that would be seen in various diseases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, and high potassium does not reflect the changes that would be seen in CHF. Though aldosterone serves to retain sodium, it also absorbs water. Thus, hypernatremia would not be seen. This pattern could be seen in patients with heart failure who have high free water losses such as after a burn or in desert environments.\n\nAnswer B: High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the appropriate increase in ADH and subsequent decrease in sodium that would be seen in CHF. Patients who have diabetes insipidus can have low ADH in this setting resulting in loss of free water.\n\nAnswer D: Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the finding of elevated BNP that is classically found in the dilated ventricles of CHF. This pattern would be seen in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH where excessive resorption of free water results in hemodilution.\n\nAnswer E: Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and normal potassium reflect the findings in a healthy patient. This patient most likely has CHF, which would result in increased aldosterone and ADH function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCommon lab findings in heart failure include elevated BNP, elevated ADH, low sodium, and low potassium.",

            "This patient\u2019s presentation is most consistent with systolic heart failure (congestive heart failure), as suggested by his recurrent dyspnea on exertion, pulmonary crackles (i.e. pulmonary edema), S3 gallop, and peripheral edema. In systolic dysfunction, the failing heart cannot effectively eject blood, leading to elevated ventricular pressures. As a result, the stretch receptors in the myocardium release increased amounts of B\u2011type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (or NT\u2011proBNP), which is a sensitive marker for heart failure. In addition, neurohormonal activation in heart failure (via the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system) can lead to mild hyponatremia and a degree of renal impairment (with modestly elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels).\n\nThus, of the provided sets of laboratory data (Figure A), the one most consistent with this patient\u2019s clinical picture would be the one showing markedly elevated BNP levels along with low serum sodium and signs of mild renal insufficiency. After comparing the choices and eliminating those that do not show the expected \u201cheart failure lab profile,\u201d the correct answer is:\n\nFinal answer: D\n\n(Answer option D is the set showing an elevated B\u2011type natriuretic peptide level with accompanying hyponatremia and mild renal impairment.)",
            "Step 1: Recognize the clinical picture. This 69\u2010year\u2010old man has recurrent episodes of dyspnea on exertion. On exam, the additional heart sound just after S2 is a classic S3 gallop, and his bilateral pulmonary crackles plus lower extremity edema support a diagnosis of volume overload from systolic (congestive) heart failure.\n\nStep 2: Review the expected lab findings in congestive heart failure. In patients with heart failure exacerbations, one typically finds an elevated level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (or NT\u2010proBNP) due to the stretching of the ventricles, as well as evidence of neurohormonal activation (which can lead to hyponatremia) and sometimes a mild rise in renal markers (BUN and creatinine) because of reduced renal perfusion from forward failure. In the absence of an ischemic event, cardiac troponin levels will generally be normal.\n\nStep 3: Compare the possible sets of lab values (as shown in Figure A) to eliminate incorrect choices. Any set of labs that does not have an elevated BNP value, or that shows markedly elevated cardiac enzymes (suggesting myocardial infarction rather than decompensated heart failure), is less consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation. Likewise, values without a low sodium (expected from neurohormonal activation in heart failure) would be less likely.\n\nStep 4: Determining the final answer.

            "We can break down the case as follows:\n\n\u2022 The patient is an older man with repeated episodes of shortness of breath, signs of volume overload (bilateral pulmonary crackles, peripheral edema), and an extra heart sound following S2 (an S3 gallop, classic for a failing, dilated ventricle). These findings point toward congestive heart failure (CHF), typically with systolic dysfunction.\n\n\u2022 In CHF the ventricles become dilated and unable to eject blood efficiently. The resulting ventricular stretch triggers the release of B\u2010type natriuretic peptide (BNP), making it a very useful diagnostic marker. In addition, neurohormonal activation leads to increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, which in turn leads to dilutional hyponatremia. Often there is evidence of early renal hypoperfusion (a \u201ccardiorenal syndrome\u201d) with mild elevations in BUN and creatinine.\n\nIf we assume that Figure A shows five panels (\u201cA\u201d through \u201cE\u201d) with differing laboratory profiles \u2013 for example, one set might show normal BNP with normal electrolytes, another very high BNP with hyponatremia and mild azotemia, etc. \u2013 the set most consistent with an acute decompensated congestive heart failure picture would be the one with an elevated plasma BNP level, low serum sodium (from ADH\u2010mediated water retention) and slight increases in BUN/creatinine.\n\nThus, after comparing and eliminating lab sets that do not show this combination, the most consistent lab profile would be the one that includes:\n\u2003\u2022 Significantly elevated BNP,\n\u2003\u2022 Low serum sodium,\n\u2003\u2022 Mildly elevated BUN and creatinine,\n\u2003\u2022 And no other findings that point to alternative diagnoses.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nFinal Answer: E"

        "question": "A 43-year-old man presents to the emergency department acutely with altered mental status. He uses intravenous drugs and is unable to offer a history. He was found unconscious in a park. His temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 80/40 mmHg, pulse is 156/min, and respirations are 26/min. Physical exam reveals an obtunded man covered in vomit, with track marks on his arm and several skin abscesses. The patient is given 4 liters of Ringer lactate and intravenous antibiotics. As the fourth liter of fluids is finishing, the patient is noted to have jugular venous distension and an oxygen saturation of 92% on nonrebreather. He is subsequently intubated. An ECG is obtained as seen in Figure A. The patient is started on norepinephrine, and his blood pressure is subsequently found to be 85/44 mmHg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "reason": "This patient who uses intravenous drugs with skin abscesses (the likely source of his infection) is hypotensive and tachycardic, with a blood pressure that is not responding to IV fluids; this is concerning for septic shock. Given his persistent hypotension, he should be started on vasopressors of which norepinephrine is first line and epinephrine is second line.\n\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening, systemic bacterial infection that leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Early management is centered on IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and workup to uncover the source. If the patient's blood pressure does not respond to IV fluids (by definition, their blood pressure will not respond to fluids in septic shock), vasopressors should be started with a goal mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. The first line vasopressor is norepinephrine, which can be titrated up for maximal effect. If this vasopressor fails to reach blood pressure goals, then the next vasopressor is either vasopressin or epinephrine (either is acceptable). If the second line vasopressor fails to increase blood pressure, then the third line vasopressor is vasopressin or epinephrine (whichever was not used as the second line pressor). Finally, the fourth line vasopressor for septic shock is phenylephrine.\n\nLevy et al. review sepsis. They update the Surviving Sepsis campaign which gives the most up to date management guidelines of sepsis including adequate fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors. They recommend early antibiotics and resuscitation to minimize morbidity and mortality.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating sinus tachycardia. Note the presence of P waves (red arrows highlighting several examples) that are present throughout all leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardioversion would be appropriate in an unstable patient with unstable vital signs in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to convert the patient to normal sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation would present with an irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves. Cardioversion would not be indicated in sinus tachycardia.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone is a potent glucocorticoid that also has mineralocorticoid properties. While giving an IV steroid may have a permissive effect on blood pressure (via upregulating alpha-1 receptors on the vasculature) there is no reason that this patient would have a low cortisol level (such as in chronic steroid use). Epinephrine is a better answer in this case, though steroids can be considered. Steroids are typically reserved for patients failing at least 2 vasopressors (unless they have a known cortisol-deficient state).\n\nAnswer D: Normal saline is unlikely to benefit this patient as he has already been sufficiently fluid resuscitated. Moreover, it seems the patient may be developing pulmonary edema (hypoxia, jugular venous distension), a sign of fluid overload.\n\nAnswer E: Phenylephrine is the fourth line vasopressor and is an alpha-1 agonist. It is much less potent than norepinephrine and epinephrine, and would not be started in the management of septic shock until the patient has received epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn septic shock, the vasopressors given (in order) are norepinephrine, epinephrine/vasopressin, then phenylephrine.",

            "Step 1: Analyze the clinical scenario. This 43\u2010year\u2010old intravenous drug user presents in septic shock (evidenced by hypotension, tachycardia, multiple infectious risk factors such as skin abscesses) and received aggressive fluid resuscitation (4 L of Ringer lactate). During the fluid infusion, the new onset of jugular venous distension and hypoxemia suggests that the patient is now in fluid overload/acute lung injury. He is subsequently intubated, and while on norepinephrine his blood pressure remains low at 85/44 mmHg.\n\nStep 2: Consider the ECG findings. Although the image is not provided, the details (tachycardia of 156/min recorded on presentation and the general context) suggest that his tachycardia is most likely a physiologic response to shock rather than a primary dysrhythmia requiring urgent electrical cardioversion. In septic shock, tachycardia is common. The ECG is provided to review for any arrhythmia that might require urgent intervention, but nothing in the stem points to an unstable arrhythmia (such as ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia with hemodynamic compromise requiring cardioversion).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the available options.\n\u2022 Option A \u2013 Cardioversion: Reserved for unstable, potentially life\u2010threatening arrhythmias. There is no clear indication of such a dysrhythmia here.\n\u2022 Option B \u2013 Epinephrine: Although it does have inotropic/vasopressor effects, it is generally not added to norepinephrine as a next step in septic shock.\n\u2022 Option C \u2013 Hydrocortisone: In septic shock that is refractory to fluid resuscitation and high\u2010dose vasopressors, current guidelines recommend considering low-dose corticosteroids. Hydrocortisone can help improve vasopressor responsiveness in refractory septic shock.\n\u2022 Option D \u2013 Normal saline: Additional fluids are contraindicated here given signs of fluid overload (JVD, hypoxemia) indicating a risk for pulmonary edema.\n\u2022 Option E \u2013 Phenylephrine: A pure alpha agonist which is generally less effective as a first-line agent and can be associated with adverse effects including reduced heart rate and compromised organ perfusion. \n\nStep 4: Final Decision. The patient is in refractory septic shock after adequate fluid resuscitation, now complicated by signs of fluid overload. The next appropriate step is to add hydrocortisone to improve his hemodynamic response. \n\nFinal Answer: Hydrocortisone (Option C).",
            "Let\u2019s break down the scenario step by step.\n\n1. The patient is a 43\u2010year\u2010old man with a history of IV drug use who presents in shock. He is likely septic from his soft tissue infections (skin abscesses, track marks), and his early management with fluids (4 L of Ringer lactate) and antibiotics is appropriate.\n\n2. However, as the fourth liter of fluids is finished, the patient develops signs of fluid overload (jugular venous distension, slight hypoxemia) so giving additional fluids (i.e. normal saline) isn\u2019t indicated.\n\n3.

Although an ECG (Figure A) is mentioned, none of the choices favor acute rhythm conversion (cardioversion) for an arrhythmia\u2014nor do they support that this is the source of his persistent hypotension. In septic shock, especially after adequate fluid resuscitation, persistent hypotension despite norepinephrine suggests refractory shock.\n\n4. In refractory septic shock after fluids and first\u2011line vasopressor therapy, the next appropriate management step is to add a corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone. Hydrocortisone can help restore hemodynamic stability in such cases and is recommended under these circumstances.\n\n5. The other options:\n\u2003\u2022 Cardioversion (A) is used for hemodynamically unstable arrhythmias, but the clinical context does not clearly show a primary arrhythmia causing the shock.\n\u2003\u2022 Epinephrine (B) can be added in septic shock but is generally reserved for when additional beta\u2011agonist effects are needed or as a second\u2011line, and it might worsen tachycardia in this already tachycardic patient.\n\u2003\u2022 Normal saline (D) would worsen his fluid overload given the signs of jugular venous distension.\n\u2003\u2022 Phenylephrine (E) is a pure \u03b1\u2011agonist and is less favorable in septic shock where both \u03b1\u2011 and \u03b2\u2011effects are helpful.\n\nThus, the most appropriate next step in management is to add hydrocortisone.\n\nFinal Answer: Hydrocortisone",
            "Step 1: Review the Clinical Picture\nThis 43\u2010year\u2010old IV drug user is in septic shock likely secondary to his soft tissue infections. His initial presentation included hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. After receiving 4 liters of Ringer lactate, he developed signs of fluid overload (the noted jugular venous distension and declining oxygen saturation) prompting intubation. Norepinephrine was started, which is appropriate as first\u2010line vasopressor support in septic shock.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing His Ongoing Hypotension\nDespite norepinephrine (a potent vasoconstrictor and first\u2010line vasopressor in septic shock), his blood pressure remains low (85/44 mmHg). In septic shock that remains refractory to fluids and initial vasopressor therapy, additional techniques are often necessary to help restore vascular tone and improve responsiveness to catecholamines.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the Options\nA. Cardioversion \u2013 This is indicated for unstable tachyarrhythmias that are the primary cause of hemodynamic compromise. In this case, there is no evidence that an arrhythmia is the primary cause; the tachycardia is a physiologic compensatory response to shock.\nB. Epinephrine \u2013 Although epinephrine has both \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010adrenergic effects and may be used as an additional vasopressor, its use is typically reserved for scenarios such as anaphylaxis or cardiac arrest, or as an adjunct in refractory septic shock. It is not the typical next step in septic shock management once norepinephrine is already in use.\nC. Hydrocortisone \u2013 In patients with septic shock who remain hypotensive despite adequate fluid resuscitation and norepinephrine infusion, the addition of low\u2010dose hydrocortisone is recommended to help reverse shock by improving the vascular responsiveness to catecholamines.\nD. Normal Saline \u2013 Additional fluid administration is not recommended at this point because the patient already shows signs of fluid overload (jugular venous distension, declining oxygen saturation).\nE. Phenylephrine \u2013 Being a pure \u03b1\u2010agonist, this vasopressor would increase systemic vascular resistance, but it lacks the \u03b2 effects that help support cardiac output. It is not the preferred choice in this clinical context.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nGiven that the patient remains hypotensive despite administration of initial fluid boluses and norepinephrine, the most appropriate next step is to add low\u2010dose hydrocortisone to help overcome catecholamine resistance in septic shock.\n\nFinal answer: C.

        "reason": "This patient with a history of possible anabolic steroid use (wrestler with acne) who presents with right upper quadrant pain and an enhancing lesion in the liver most likely has a hepatic adenoma. The treatment of hepatic adenomas is surgical removal and discontinuation of precipitating agents.\n\nHepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors that typically arise in the right hepatic lobe. They are typically solitary masses but multiple lesions can be seen in patients with prolonged contraceptive or anabolic steroid use and those who have glycogen storage disorders. Patients present with abdominal pain that is localized in the epigastrium or in the right upper quadrant. Sudden, severe abdominal pain with hypotension suggests rupture of the hepatic adenoma into the peritoneum. The lesions can be confirmed on imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. For hepatic adenomas that are < 5 cm and asymptomatic, simply discontinuing the causative drug and observing are acceptable. Large or symptomatic lesions requiring surgical resection in addition to discontinuation of the offending agent. Because these tumors are highly vascular, failure to resect may result in rupture, hemoperitoneum, and shock. Biopsy is contraindicated to avoid rupturing the mass and causing hemorrhage.\n\nKlompenhouwer et al. studied the current management strategies in patients with hepatocellular adenoma. They found that various molecular groups have been identified allowing for subtyping of these lesions. They recommend performing a CT scan to better characterize these lesions.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT with an enhancing mass with a hypoattenuating fatty component. This is characteristically seen in large hepatic adenomas, which are solitary well-marginated lesions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole would be an effective treatment if this patient had contracted Entamoeba histolytica from contaminated food or water on his recent trip to Mexico. While this amoeba can lead to a liver abscess presenting as a mass on CT, it often also causes abdominal pain and dysentery due to intestinal involvement.\n\nAnswer B: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used for hepatitis C. This patient does have risk factors for hepatitis C (risky sexual behavior and intravenous drug use). Although hepatitis C could lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cause a liver mass, this patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Even if he did have hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatitis C alone without surgical resection or adjuvant therapies would be insufficient.\n\nAnswer C: Follow-up CT in 3 months would be dangerous for this man with a large hepatic adenoma. In the interim, the mass will likely continue to grow if he continues to use anabolic steroids, increasing the risk of rupture. Observation and repeat imaging may be suitable for asymptomatic hepatic lesions that are of uncertain but likely benign etiology.\n\nAnswer D: Biopsying the liver mass is appropriate if malignancy is suspected and there is no concern for hepatic adenoma. If an adenoma is on the differential, biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of rupture and hemorrhage intraoperatively.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHepatic adenomas are benign, vascular liver masses associated with oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids that should be promptly resected if large and symptomatic.",

The most appropriate initial intervention is magnesium.\n\nPreeclampsia classically presents after 20 weeks gestation (or earlier in the setting of a molar pregnancy) with hypertension and proteinuria. Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed. The most important initial step in management is to administer magnesium which is neuroprotective and also modestly lowers blood pressure.

A CTA may localize a bleeding aneurysm and a lumbar puncture would show an elevated red blood cell count in the CSF. It would not explain this patient\u2019s hypertension and abdominal pain. Note that a CT head is not a CTV which is specific venous imaging.\n\nAnswer B: Labetalol is an appropriate blood pressure medication to give in pregnancy; however, it is more appropriate to first give magnesium as this agent is neuroprotective and is the first-line agent of choice in preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer D: MRV head or a CTV head would be appropriate in the workup of cerebral venous thrombosis which is common in the setting of hypercoagulability (such as in the postpartum period) and presents with headache, blurry vision, and seizures. Note that it would not explain this patient\u2019s profound hypertension. It would be more reasonable to first empirically treat this patient's possible preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer E: Ondansetron and morphine would be appropriate symptomatic management of this patient but would not treat her underlying preeclampsia. It is more appropriate to first treat the life-threatening diagnosis before symptom management. If this patient\u2019s hypertension was thought to be due to pain, then morphine could be helpful.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPreeclampsia can occur in the postpartum period and should be managed with magnesium sulfate.",

However, his bleeding resolved with pressure and nasal packing. Upon presentation to the ED today, his temperature is 97.6\u00b0F (36.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 64/33 mmHg, pulse is 160/min, respirations are 32/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with nasal packing, hypotension, tachycardia, a dark, purpuric rash, and confusion, which are concerning for toxic shock syndrome. The most important initial step in management is to administer clindamycin.\n\nToxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening diagnosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and occurs commonly secondary to retained tampons or nasal packing. Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates. It is a relatively weaker antibiotic and would not be used in a critically ill patient with toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAnswers 4 & 5: Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin represent a powerful broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics that covers gram-positives, gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes (piperacillin-tazobactam) as well as further gram-positive coverage and MRSA (vancomycin). Though this is a potent antibiotic combination, neither of these takes priority over clindamycin given the possible benefit of toxin suppression from clindamycin. In this patient, clindamycin and piperacillin-tazobactam would be an appropriate antibiotic regimen.\n\nBullet Summary:\nClindamycin may suppress toxin production and should be given early in toxic shock syndrome.",

ARVD is an autosomal dominant condition where there is fatty infiltration of the right ventricular wall predisposing the patient (classically younger patients) to sudden cardiac death from lethal ventricular dysrhythmias. The epsilon wave is the most specific finding; however, other findings include T wave inversion in V1-V3 or a left bundle branch appearance with frequent premature ventricular complexes among other possibilities.

        "reason": "This patient with confusion, dark urine, and peaked T waves on electrocardiogram in the setting of a prolonged time spent down likely has developed rhabdomyolysis with associated hyperkalemia. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",

Although supportive measures (fluids, warming, vasopressors) have already been initiated, the underlying severe hypothyroidism must be addressed immediately.\n\nStep 2: In the management of myxedema coma, waiting for laboratory confirmation (TSH and free T4 levels) is not appropriate because of the high risk of mortality if treatment is delayed. The mainstay of treatment in this emergency situation is the administration of thyroid hormone replacement. Typically, intravenous levothyroxine is the preferred initial therapy.\n\nStep 3: Review of the answer options:\n\u2022 Option A (Free T4 level) and Option D (TSH level) as well as Option C (TSH and free T4 level) involve diagnostic testing which may delay life-saving treatment.\n\u2022 Option E (Triiodothyronine administration) is not recommended as the primary therapy because T3 is more potent, and its administration can increase the risk of arrhythmias, especially in elderly patients.\n\u2022 Option B (Levothyroxine administration) is the best immediate step to correct the severe hypothyroidism in a patient with myxedema coma.\n\nFinal answer: B. Levothyroxine administration."

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with dizziness and syncope in the setting of likely dehydration (working in a hot/humid environment without water) and feels better after rehydration, suggesting a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. An ECG is performed and incidentally demonstrates a bifascicular block, which is at high risk of progressing to a complete heart block.\n\nBifascular block is a conduction abnormality in 2 of the 3 fascicles that conduct electricity from atria to ventricles. This leaves conduction to the ventricles via the single remaining fascicle. There are different possibilities that may present on ECG. One possibility is a right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block; the other is a right bundle branch block with a left posterior fascicular block. Note that the pathophysiology of complete heart block is an inability to conduct electricity from the atria to the ventricles. If there is only 1 fascicle left to conduct electricity, the patient would be in complete heart block if this fascicle were to no longer work, which is a common outcome in patients with bifascicular block. Treatment of complete heart block involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nWiberg et al. discuss bifascicular block. They note the possible outcome of a complete heart block. It is recommended to look for this finding on ECG and appropriately workup patients to prevent progression of disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bifascicular block. Note the left axis deviation as suggested by the net upward deflection of the QRS in lead I and net downward deflection in lead II (blue arrows). Then, note the appearance of a right bundle branch block with the RSR pattern in aVR (black arrow) and upward R\u2019 in lead V1 (green arrow). This is a classic pattern for bifascicular block. Contrast this to the other pattern of bifascicular block which would present with a right bundle branch block and right axis deviation (upward QRS in lead II and downward in lead I), which was not seen in this case.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atrial fibrillation may occur secondary to aging, hypertension, or ischemia and presents with an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with an absence of P waves. It may cause complications such as stroke. Management typically involves rate control agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction is a likely outcome in individuals with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, in particular, without proper preventive measures and medical therapy including statins, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors. This patient may be at risk of a myocardial infarction with his hypertension, and his underlying bifascicular block could suggest undiagnosed cardiac ischemia; however, it is more likely this patient progresses to complete heart block in the setting of his bifascicular block.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke is a possible complication of atrial fibrillation. For this reason, most patients with atrial fibrillation are on blood thinners to prevent this complication. It occurs secondary to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium. Patients are often risk stratified prior to starting blood thinners with tools such as CHADS2VASC and HASBLED. Isolated syncope is a rare manifestation of stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Torsades des pointes is a progression from QT prolongation which may occur secondary to genetic conditions, medications, and/or infection. It presents on ECG with QRS complexes that twist in amplitude around the electrical baseline. Treatment involves the administration of magnesium sulfate and, if needed, electrical cardioversion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA bifascicular block can progress to complete heart block.",

Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death. Patients with neurologic findings or those with expanding bleeds require urgent surgical decompression.\n\nDadashi et al. present cases of patients with epidural hematoma from acute trauma. They discuss how patients often sustain these injuries from extreme sports. They recommend being aware of this syndrome so that acute interventions can be taken.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates a biconvex hyperdensity that is limited by suture lines (red circle). This is the typical appearance of an epidural hematoma on head CT.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Damage to the cerebral bridging veins results in a subdural hematoma (SDH). An acute SDH more commonly presents with a gradual increase in headache and confusion rather than the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome presented in this vignette. However, a minority of patients with acute SDH may have a lucid interval followed by progressive neurological decline. SDH would have a crescent-shaped appearance on head CT rather than the biconvex appearance of an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer C: Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries describes a lacunar stroke. Although this patient has 2 risk factors for lacunar stroke (hypertension and smoking), this patient\u2019s head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer D: A ruptured cerebral aneurysm would most likely lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subarachnoid hemorrhage presents as a sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap headache\u201d), confusion or somnolence, nausea and vomiting, and meningismus. Surgical clipping or embolization of the bleeding vessel may be required.\n\nAnswer E: Secondary hemorrhage into a prior area of infarction usually occurs in the setting of a recent embolic stroke. Although this patient has a history of TIA and other risk factors for stroke, his head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma. Treatment is supportive with the control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nBullet Summary:\nEpidural hematomas are caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery as it passes through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone.",

        "reason": "This pediatric patient presents with features of Down syndrome (trisomy 21), bilious vomiting, and colonic distention on an abdominal radiograph, which suggests a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nHirschsprung disease is associated with Down syndrome and presents with bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium in the first 48 hours of life, and abdominal distension. A digital rectal exam may temporarily relieve the obstruction and lead to the expulsion of gas and stool (the \u201csquirt sign\u201d). Abdominal radiography typically demonstrates signs of distal intestinal obstruction such as proximal dilation and an absence of air in the rectum. Contrast enema may reveal a transition zone between the dilated proximal megacolon and the narrow rectosigmoid colon. A biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with surgical removal of the defective segment of the bowel.\n\nKessman reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Hirschsprung disease. She discusses how the diagnosis can be made using a rectal suction biopsy. She recommends monitoring patients closely for enterocolitis for years after surgical treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an abdominal radiograph that demonstrates colonic distension (red circle). This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Duodenal atresia is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and may also present in the first 48 hours of life with bilious vomiting. The abdominal radiograph will demonstrate the \u201cdouble bubble\u201d sign, which reflects air trapping in the stomach and first portion of the duodenum. Treatment is with the surgical opening of the atretic segment.\n\nAnswer C: Intestinal malrotation may preset with bilious vomiting in a neonate due to the development of a midgut volvulus. An abdominal radiograph may show the extension of the nasogastric tube into an abnormally positioned duodenum and would not show diffuse colonic distension. Treatment is with surgical derotation of the volvulus.\n\nAnswer D: Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and also presents with delayed (> 48 hours) passing of meconium. The distal obstruction in these patients will not be temporarily relieved by a digital rectal exam. Contrast enema will demonstrate microcolon involving the entire large bowel. Treatment is with irrigation and removal of the meconium.\n\nAnswer E: Pyloric stenosis usually presents in the first 3-6 weeks of life with post-prandial, nonbilious, projectile vomiting and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastrium. This patient is presenting at just 2 days of life and has bilious vomiting. Treatment is with surgical release of the stenosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHirschsprung disease is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and presents with retention of stool that can be relieved by digital disimpaction, bilious vomiting, and colonic distention on abdominal radiography.",

A vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery was eventually performed. The child\u2019s Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia in the mother which was well-controlled throughout the pregnancy.

Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days. Treatment is supportive though patients may occasionally require phototherapy if they develop high levels of bilirubin. Transfusion is indicated if there is significant anemia present (though this is uncommon).\n\nJacob and Hoerter present evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with caput succedaneum. They discuss how this lesion commonly crosses cranial suture lines as well as the midline. They recommend differentiating this disease from more malignant etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage found in neonates, but they usually present with more serious signs of respiratory depression, apnea, or seizures. Patients with a subdural hematoma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Treatment of expanding lesions may require surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage, an uncommon but serious complication of traumatic birth. Like caput succedaneum, subgaleal hemorrhages occur most commonly in newborns delivered via vacuum-assisted delivery, but the swelling in a subgaleal hemorrhage involves the entire scalp. Patients may also present with signs of extensive blood loss and neurological disturbances. Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines. The treatment for these lesions is supportive as most of these lesions resolve spontaneously.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding into the lateral ventricles describes an intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with premature delivery and usually presents with neurological symptoms. Neurologic findings include seizures, apnea, respiratory depression, or asymmetric reflexes. Treatment may involve urgent surgical decompression to prevent herniation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCaput succedaneum is an extracranial injury caused by bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurotica in neonates.",

Between periosteum and skull",
            "Step 1: Key aspects of the patient\u2019s presentation include a newborn girl delivered at 38 weeks via vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, with scalp swelling that was not present at birth. The swelling is localized (4\u00d75\u202fcm) over the bilateral parietal bones, is ecchymotic, and does not appear to change in size on serial head circumference measurements.\n\nStep 2: The differential diagnosis for scalp swellings in the neonatal period includes caput succedaneum, cephalohematoma, and subgaleal hemorrhage. Caput succedaneum is usually present at birth (often due to molding) and crosses suture lines. Subgaleal hemorrhage, often associated with vacuum extraction, accumulates in the potential space between the periosteum and the galea aponeurotica, and it can cross suture lines; it is usually fluctuant and may cause progressive increases in head circumference given the capacity for significant blood accumulation. Cephalohematoma is a subperiosteal hemorrhage (i.e., it occurs between the periosteum and the skull) that does not cross suture lines and tends to develop a few hours after birth.\n\nStep 3: The child\u2019s swelling, being localized and showing no progression of head circumference, is most consistent with a cephalohematoma. Therefore, the affected space in this condition is between the periosteum and the skull.\n\nFinal Answer: C. Between periosteum and skull",

It is confined to one cranial bone (does not cross suture lines), and although often not markedly ecchymotic, it may appear bruised.\n\u2022 Subgaleal Hemorrhage: A potentially larger area of bleeding between the skull periosteum and the galea aponeurosis that can expand over time, often leading to a rising head circumference in serial measurements.\n\nStep 3: Compare Findings with Each Condition\n\u2022 The swelling did not have a progressive increase in head circumference over the next 12 hours, arguing against a subgaleal hemorrhage (which can be life-threatening due to continuous bleeding).\n\u2022 The lesion is localized, and since cephalohematomas are limited by suture lines, the bilateral parietal location is most consistent with cephalohematoma. Although cephalohematomas are usually not present at birth, they can become noticeable a few hours later.\n\u2022 The use of vacuum-assisted delivery is a known risk factor for cephalohematoma.\n\nStep 4: Identify the Anatomic Location\n\u2022 Cephalohematoma is characterized as a subperiosteal hemorrhage, meaning that the bleeding occurs between the periosteum and the skull bone.\n\nFinal Answer: C.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a preceding viral illness, dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus (blood pressure drop from 150/85 to 130/70 mmHg during inspiration), an echocardiogram with impaired diastolic filling, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG. This constellation of symptoms is concerning for constrictive pericarditis.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic. In contrast to other types of pericarditis, in constrictive pericarditis, there is impaired diastolic filling and thus impaired cardiac function. There are many possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis including infection, inflammatory conditions, or idiopathic. Patients will present with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, a pericardial friction rub, and positional chest pain (usually worsened by laying back and relieved by leaning forward). Patients may also demonstrate jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, worsening dyspnea, and congestive hepatopathy. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, and an echocardiogram will demonstrate impaired diastolic filling and may demonstrate a thickened pericardium. The diagnosis can be supported with pulsus paradoxus (a drop of blood pressure by > 10 mmHg during inspiration).\n\nWelch reviews constrictive pericarditis. He discusses constrictive pericarditis and how the inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling possibly causing unexplained heart failure. Welch notes making the diagnosis is very challenging and requires meticulous echocardiograph assessment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates diffuse ST elevation (blue arrows) with PR depression (black arrows). This is consistent with pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, in the setting of infection, or in the setting of autoimmune disease and is more likely to occur with a rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid. While pulsus paradoxus would be present in this condition, muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans would be more likely to be seen on ECG. Echocardiography would demonstrate an echogenic rim of fluid around the heart.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction presents with chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, and ST elevation in a vascular distribution. Note that this patient\u2019s ST elevation is diffuse and there is no reciprocal ST depression. Moreover, the pattern of chest pain in myocardial infarction is typically exertional and not positional.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary embolism may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, hemoptysis, a history of hypercoagulability, and recent stasis or surgery (such as this patient\u2019s recent Achilles tendon surgery). It can cause obstructive shock leading to hypotension and tachycardia. Note that right heart strain and sinus tachycardia would be seen on ECG.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents very similarly to restrictive pericarditis. Note that in restrictive cardiomyopathy, patients will also have impaired diastolic filling; however, it is due to a myocardium that will not expand rather than the pericardium impairing filling. It can occur secondary to conditions such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis as well as other chronic inflammatory states. The ECG findings are nonspecific but may include low voltage QRS complexes, ST segment changes, T wave changes, bundle branch blocks, and pathologic Q waves (abnormally deep and wide Q waves). The diagnosis can be supported with an ultrasound demonstrating impaired diastolic filling and possible myocardial speckling if a protein (amyloid) is present and deposited in the myocardial wall. The diagnosis can only definitively be confirmed with a biopsy which is highly invasive.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRestrictive pericarditis presents with chest pain that is positional, pulsus paradoxus, a friction rub, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG.",

            "Step 1: Gather the key details. This 55\u2010year\u2010old man has worsening dyspnea, a recent \u201ccold\u201d (suggesting a viral illness, which can be associated with pericardial inflammation), and a history that includes recent surgery (which can predispose to thromboembolic events, though his exam does not support this). On exam he has jugular venous distension, and his blood pressure during inspiration is noted to be 130/70 mmHg, indicating a significant drop from his baseline (a hallmark of pulsus paradoxus). The bedside echocardiogram demonstrates impaired diastolic filling with preserved ventricular contractility.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the answer choices by comparing the clinical clues:\n\n\u2022 Cardiac tamponade (Choice A): Classically presents with jugular venous distension, signs of impaired diastolic filling, and especially pulsus paradoxus (a drop in systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg during inspiration). A preceding viral illness can lead to pericarditis and subsequent fluid accumulation.\n\n\u2022 Constrictive pericarditis (Choice B): Also causes impaired diastolic filling and JVD; however, it is more chronic in nature and less likely to show marked pulsus paradoxus. There is typically a pericardial knock and a longer history of risk factors (e.g., TB, prior radiation) rather than a recent viral illness.\n\n\u2022 Myocardial infarction (Choice C): Would likely present with chest pain and may show wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram rather than isolated diastolic filling issues with normal contractility.\n\n\u2022 Pulmonary embolism (Choice D): Although his recent lower extremity surgery raises the possibility of deep vein thrombosis and PE, his oxygen saturation is normal, he is not tachycardic, and his echo does not show signs of right ventricular strain.\n\n\u2022 Restrictive cardiomyopathy (Choice E): While this condition can cause impaired diastolic filling and present similarly with JVD, it is typically due to chronic infiltrative processes (like amyloidosis) and does not characteristically produce pulsus paradoxus.\n\nStep 3: Synthesize the findings. The presence of pulsus paradoxus, JVD, and an echo showing impaired diastolic filling with preserved contractility, along with a recent viral illness, all point to an acute pericardial process consistent with cardiac tamponade.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Cardiac tamponade.",
            "Step 1: Key Points in the Question\n\u2022 The patient is a 55\u2010year\u2010old man with worsening dyspnea over 48 hours.\n\u2022 He has risk factors (diabetes, obesity, hypertension) but also a history of a \u201ccold\u201d a week ago.\n\u2022 He had Achilles tendon repair 4 weeks ago with reduced mobility (raising concern for thromboembolic events, but other findings will guide us).\n\u2022 Vital signs: Temperature minimally elevated; blood pressure of 150/85 mmHg that drops to 130/70 mmHg during inspiration (a significant drop, suggesting pulsus paradoxus); pulse 82/min; respirations 16/min; oxygen saturation 100% on room air.\n\u2022 Physical exam: Dyspnea on exertion and jugular venous distension.\n\u2022 Bedside echocardiogram shows impaired diastolic filling with normal ventricular contractility.\n\u2022 An ECG (Figure A) is provided, which in the setting of a pericardial problem may show findings such as low-voltage QRS or electrical alternans.\n\nStep 2: Interpreting Each Clue\n\u2022 Impaired diastolic filling with preserved contractility is classically seen when something external (like pericardial fluid) is restricting the heart filling rather than intrinsic myocardial dysfunction.\n\u2022 The inspiratory drop in blood pressure (from 150/85 to 130/70) indicates pulsus paradoxus, which is most commonly associated with pericardial tamponade.\n\u2022 Jugular venous distension also fits with an impediment to normal right heart filling due to external compression.\n\u2022 Although his recent immobility after tendon repair might raise the possibility of a pulmonary embolism, his normal oxygen saturation and a heart rate that is not elevated argue strongly against PE.\n\u2022 Constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy can cause diastolic dysfunction, but there are differences:\n\u2003 \u2013 Constrictive pericarditis is usually a chronic process and often has a history of TB, radiation, or prior pericarditis. The timeline here (symptoms worsening over 48 hours after a cold) is too acute.\n\u2003 \u2013 Restrictive cardiomyopathy usually does not manifest with marked pulsus paradoxus.\n\u2022 Cardiac tamponade, on the other hand, fits very well with the findings: an acute process (perhaps following viral pericarditis after a \u201ccold\u201d), tachycardia may be mild or absent early on, and the echo would show diastolic dysfunction due to compression, with preserved contractility.\n\nStep 3: Eliminating Other Options\nA. Cardiac tamponade \u2013 The presence of a significant inspiratory drop in blood pressure (pulsus paradoxus), the echo findings, and the overall clinical context make this the best fit.\nB. Constrictive pericarditis \u2013 Typically a more chronic condition with a different clinical history.\nC. Myocardial infarction \u2013 Would usually be associated with wall motion abnormalities (not preserved contractility) and chest pain.\nD. Pulmonary embolism \u2013 The patient\u2019s normal oxygen saturation, absence of tachycardia, and echo findings make this unlikely.\nE. Restrictive cardiomyopathy \u2013 While it presents with impaired diastolic filling, it does not typically cause marked pulsus paradoxus and the clinical scenario would be different.\n\nStep 4: Final Answer\nThe most likely diagnosis is Cardiac tamponade.\n\nFinal Answer: A.

Cardiac tamponade \u2013 Presents with \u201cpulsus paradoxus\u201d (often an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure on inspiration), hypotension, and on echo, signs like right atrial collapse or pericardial effusion. Our patient, however, is not hypotensive, has normal heart rate, and the echo only shows impaired filling without evidence of chamber collapse.\nB. Constrictive pericarditis \u2013 Results in impaired diastolic filling because of a stiff, often fibrotic or calcified pericardium, while systolic function remains normal. It often manifests with raised jugular venous pressure and features such as a Kussmaul sign (increase in JVP on inspiration) and may follow a bout of viral pericarditis (his recent cold could be relevant here).\nC. Myocardial infarction \u2013 Would typically involve chest pain, ECG changes specific to ischemia or infarction, and usually impairment of systolic function.\nD. Pulmonary embolism \u2013 Although his recent immobilization is a risk factor, a PE would tend to cause hypoxemia, tachypnea, and findings of right ventricular strain on echo rather than the isolated diastolic filling impairment described.\nE. Restrictive cardiomyopathy \u2013 Also produces impaired diastolic filling with preserved systolic function. However, this is generally due to a myocardial (often infiltrative) process; the patient\u2019s history does not suggest an infiltrative disorder.\n\nStep 3: Compare and eliminate.\n\u2022 Cardiac tamponade (A) is less likely due to the lack of tachycardia, hypotension, and specific echo findings.\n\u2022 Myocardial infarction (C) and pulmonary embolism (D) do not match the echo findings and overall clinical picture.\n\u2022 Restrictive cardiomyopathy (E) is a consideration, but the absence of a history suggestive of infiltrative disease (like amyloidosis or hemochromatosis) in this patient makes it less likely.\n\nStep 4: Final answer.\nGiven the impaired diastolic filling with preserved contractility, the elevated jugular venous pressure, and the historical clue of a recent cold (which could have led to a viral pericarditis evolving into a constrictive process), the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nB.

Digoxin is an appropriate medication that can both control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation and increase cardiac contractility and potentially improve respiratory symptoms in this decompensated patient with heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation presents on ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. The initial management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate control. If the patient is stable, possible first-line agents include beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem). These agents may reduce cardiac contractility and worsen complications such as pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when the patient is in a decompensated state. If the patient has a reduced ejection fraction and requires rate control, then digoxin is a highly effective medication that blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should immediately be cardioverted.\n\nMoskowitz et. al review the management of atrial fibrillation. They note that in the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metoprolol is commonly used in the intensive care setting, is more successful than amiodarone, and had better rate control when compared to diltiazem.\n\nEhle et. al note that digoxin is approved to control ventricular response in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and is the only oral agent with positive inotropic effects approved for the management of mild to moderate heart failure.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating an irregularly irregular rate/rhythm (note the spacing of the blue arrows indicating the QRS complexes) without P waves, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Figure B is a chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral, hazy interstitial infiltrates, which are concerning for pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and prednisone would be appropriate management of a COPD flare, which presents in a patient with a history of smoking with dyspnea, wheezing, increased work of breathing, and a barrel chest. While this patient\u2019s wheezing may be secondary to his COPD, it is much more likely to be a cardiac wheeze given his chest radiograph findings including pulmonary edema. Treating his atrial fibrillation is more likely to alleviate his pulmonary symptoms. Other treatments in COPD include ipratropium and BiPAP.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem would be an appropriate rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of a COPD flare as it will not impair the mechanism of albuterol (which should be given as a nebulizer in COPD flares). In this patient, further impairing cardiac contractility with a calcium channel blocker may worsen his underlying pulmonary edema (given his reduced ejection fraction).\n\nAnswer D: Intubation would be indicated if this patient\u2019s respiratory status were worsening, including failure to oxygenate, failure to ventilate, or impending respiratory failure. This patient\u2019s respiratory status has improved on BiPAP; thus intubation is not needed.\n\nAnswer E: Metoprolol, like diltiazem, would reduce cardiac contractility and may worsen pulmonary edema, in particular, in a patient with a reduced ejection fraction. It also may cause COPD symptoms to emerge, as beta-2 blockade may cause bronchoconstriction (even though metoprolol is beta-1 selective). It would be indicated as outpatient rate control for a patient with atrial fibrillation who can tolerate a beta-blocker, and is preferred in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, as it reduces mortality.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with a reduced ejection fraction may be optimally managed with digoxin, which blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility.",

Albuterol and prednisone \u2013 These are used to treat asthma/COPD exacerbations. Although the patient has COPD, his primary issue here is decompensated heart failure with a rapid heart rate, not an acute COPD exacerbation.\nB.

Although this patient has COPD, his presentation and exam point more toward cardiac decompensation rather than a primary COPD crisis.\n\u2003\u2022 Option C (Diltiazem) is contraindicated in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction because non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can worsen contractility.\n\u2003\u2022 Option D (Intubation) is reserved for patients who are failing non-invasive measures. His oxygen saturation improved with BiPAP, so intubation isn\u2019t currently necessary.\n\u2003\u2022 Option E (Metoprolol) is a beta blocker and, while it is used for rate control, it is generally not initiated (or dose-escalated) acutely in decompensated heart failure due to its negative inotropic effects.\n\u2003\u2022 Option B (Digoxin) is favored in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. It provides rate control and has a positive inotropic effect, making it the most appropriate choice in this setting.\n\nStep 3: The best next step in management for this patient is rate control using digoxin.\n\nFinal answer: Digoxin."

        "reason": "This postmenopausal patient is presenting with vulvovaginal dryness and irritation, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infections, likely due to genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). The most appropriate initial treatment is symptomatic relief with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nReduced estrogen levels after menopause lead to vulvovaginal atrophy by causing reduced blood flow and collagen content in vulvovaginal tissues. Patients typically have thin vulvar skin and loss of vaginal tissue pliability. The bladder and urethral epithelium may also atrophy leading to dysuria and urinary frequency. Atrophic tissue becomes thin, dry, and susceptible to injury. The first line of treatment is vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If this does not improve symptoms, the next step in treatment is vaginal estrogen to help restore blood flow in vulvovaginal tissues. Finally, hormone replacement therapy is indicated if symptoms are refractory to all other modalities.\n\nBhupathiraju et al. studied the association between vaginal estrogen and chronic disease risk. The authors found no association between low-dose vaginal estrogen and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and hip fractures over an 18-year period. The authors recommended that low-dose vaginal estrogen can be used indefinitely without concomitant progestin therapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole is the treatment for trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis. While patients with trichomoniasis can present with cervical petechiae and punctate hemorrhages, they typically also have frothy green discharge (absent in this patient). While patients with bacterial vaginosis can also have vaginal discharge, the discharge is typically malodorous and symptoms of pruritis are generally absent.\n\nAnswer B: Nitrofurantoin is the treatment of choice for urinary tract infections. While this patient has increased urinary frequency and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, her normal urinalysis makes the diagnosis of urinary tract infection unlikely.\n\nAnswer C: Topical clobetasol cream is the treatment for lichen sclerosis. While lichen sclerosis can present with pain with intercourse and vulvar pruritis, patients often have plaques that disrupt the normal vulvar architecture. Lichen sclerosis does not affect the vaginal tissues.\n\nAnswer D: Topical estrogen is the treatment of choice for cases of vulvovaginal atrophy resistant to treatment with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. This patient should first be trialed on vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nBullet Summary:\nVulvovaginal atrophy is initially treated with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.",

        "reason": "This patient's progressively increasing PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex on ECG is consistent with second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, Mobitz type I, also referred to as Wenckebach phenomenon.\n\nSecond degree AV block, Mobitz type I can occur in a variety of settings, such as in the context of digoxin, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or increased vagal tone. On ECG, there is progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex (a dropped beat); then, the PR interval resets. Patients are typically asymptomatic, but should undergo evaluation for an underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia, such as electrolyte imbalances, medication side effect, or structural heart disease, as well as a follow-up ECG to evaluate for any progression. If the dysrhythmia is caused by medication, the offending agent should be discontinued, but otherwise there are no specific treatments necessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic and hemodynamically stable can undergo telemetry monitoring and receive atropine with limited efficacy. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and not responsive to atropine may need cardiac pacing. Generally, there is a low risk of progression to third degree AV block, and a pacemaker is rarely required (in contrast to second degree heart block type II).\n\nBarold and Hayes review second-degree heart block. They note the changes in AV node conduction time on ECG in this condition. They recommend using the correct definition of the different heart blocks for the correct underlying treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG showing PR intervals that gradually prolong until a P wave is seen not followed by a QRS complex (note the blue bars that show the progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until the dropped beat).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: First degree AV block is seen on ECG with prolonged PR intervals greater than 0.2 sec, but a consistent 1:1 ratio of P waves to QRS complexes. This finding is typically found in younger patients with increased vagal tone or in athletes, and does not require treatment.\n\nAnswer C: Second degree AV block, Mobitz type II is seen with fixed PR intervals and occasional dropped QRS complexes. Patients with Mobitz II sometimes present with syncope and frequently progress to third degree AV block. This finding may be associated with fibrotic changes to the conduction system or from acute, subacute, or prior myocardial infarction, and should be treated with placement of a pacemaker in most cases.\n\nAnswer D: Sinus bradycardia findings on ECG include normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Patients with sinus bradycardia may be asymptomatic, but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness, chest pain, or hypotension. No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic, but atropine may be given to increase the heart rate in symptomatic cases. Pacemaker placement is required for patients with chronic symptoms.\n\nAnswer E: Third-degree AV block occurs when the atria and ventricles depolarize independently on ECG. There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. Patients may present with syncope, dizziness, acute heart failure, or hypotension. The treatment is pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSecond degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type I, is characterized by progressively lengthening PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex.",

            "Step 1: Recognize that the patient has a markedly elevated white blood cell count (66,500/mm\u00b3) with a normal differential. In evaluating such cases, it is important to distinguish between a neoplastic process (such as chronic myeloid leukemia, which classically presents with high WBC counts) and a reactive process, a leukemoid reaction.\n\nStep 2: Note the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) level. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), LAP is typically low due to the presence of malignant neutrophils that lack normal enzyme activity. In contrast, an elevated LAP suggests that the neutrophils are reactive in nature, supporting the diagnosis of a leukemoid reaction.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate other options:\n\u2022 Option A (Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma) and Option B (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia) are not consistent with the neutrophilic predominance and the lab findings.\n\u2022 Option C (Chronic myeloid leukemia) would present with a decreased LAP.\n\u2022 Option E (Multiple myeloma) typically involves plasma cell dyscrasia with lytic bone lesions and other laboratory findings that are not present here.\n\nStep 4: Conclude that because of the high WBC count with a normal differential and an elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, the most likely diagnosis is a leukemoid reaction.\n\nFinal Answer: D.

Current medications include lisinopril, inhaled umeclidinium-vilanterol, and as-needed albuterol. He drinks 4 beers a day and has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes a day for 40 years. His temperature is 98.9\u00b0 F (37.2\u00b0 C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, and respirations are 16/min. Physical exam is notable for an irregular pulse and scattered end-expiratory wheezes. An echocardiogram performed 1 month ago showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65%.

        "reason": "This patient\u2019s new-onset palpitations, irregularly irregular pulse, and absent p-waves on ECG are consistent with atrial fibrillation. In hemodynamically stable patients with a relative contraindication to \u03b2-blockers (COPD on home oxygen with increasing oxygen need), rate control with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil is preferred.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can present with palpitations, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. ECG findings will be an irregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves with an erratic baseline as shown in Illustration A. Treatment is centered on rate control. First-line agents for rate control include \u03b21 selective blockers (metoprolol and esmolol) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem). In patients with COPD, non-selective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol, timolol, and sotalol) can worsen bronchoconstriction by activating \u03b22-adrenoreceptors. Other relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers include Raynaud disease and depression (increased risk of fatigue and sexual dysfunction). In patients with relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred initial treatment option.\n\nVan Gelder et al. studied lenient (resting heart rate < 110 beats per minute) versus strict rate control (resting heart rate < 80 beats per minute) in patients with atrial fibrillation in a randomized control trial. The authors found that there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmias between the 2 groups. The authors recommend a lenient rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG lacking P waves (red arrows) and irregularly irregular RR intervals (red/blue lines), which are classic findings in atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic that can be used in patients to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It is often suitable to use in patients with depressed left ventricular function. Amiodarone has multiple multi-system adverse effects including pulmonary toxicity, and it is not used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer B: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that can be used to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Although patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, the preferred anticoagulation agents are warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban).\n\nAnswer C: Digoxin can be used as a rate control agent in atrial fibrillation as it directly suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction. Due to its narrow therapeutic window and risk of toxicity, it is used as second-line therapy when first-line agents fail.\n\nAnswer D: Metoprolol is a \u03b2-blocker that is a first-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. In patients with contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice. This patient has COPD with increasing oxygen needs making calcium channel blockers possibly a better choice.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn hemodynamically stable patients with atrial fibrillation and relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice.",

The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin. Factor concentrate can also be used to rapidly reverse anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain would be indicated in the workup of a stroke or transient ischemic attack after all emergency interventions and labs including CT head, serum chemistries, CBC, and ECG. It delineates the extent of the stroke and gives useful prognostic and diagnostic information. It also may elucidate strokes missed on other forms of neuroimaging such as CT perfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA fingerstick blood glucose should be obtained immediately in all patients with stroke-like symptoms or altered mental status.",

        "reason": "This patient with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, deviation of the tongue to the right, left-sided hemiparesis, and decreased sensation to light touch and vibration on the left side of his body most likely has a stroke of the right medial medulla. The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation. Treatment includes reperfusion via thrombolytics if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of the time last known well.\n\nKim and Han present clinical findings, radiographic findings, angiographic data, and long-term outcomes from a case series of 86 patients with medial medullary infarction. The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome). This leads to lesions to the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Clinically this presents with dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased gag reflex, vomiting, vertigo, decreased pain and temperature sensation from the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, and ipsilateral ataxia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOcclusion of the anterior spinal artery can lead to medial medullary syndrome, which presents with ipsilateral deviation of the tongue, contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities, and contralateral loss of light touch and vibration sensation.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with chest pain and an ECG demonstrating hyperacute T waves (leads V2-V6) which is an early finding concerning for a myocardial infarction.\n\nA myocardial infarction occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures causing occlusion of a coronary artery. Patients classically present with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Atypical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction may include abdominal pain, nausea, reflux symptoms, and dizziness. The most important initial step in management is to administer aspirin as it lowers mortality and carries minimal risk. An ECG should then be performed. Classically, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will demonstrate ST elevations in a vascular distribution. However, the progression to a STEMI is usually stepwise and may present with ST depressions, hyperacute T waves, pseudonormalization of the ST segment (a normal ST segment after a depression as it elevates), ST elevations, and finally tombstoning (a concave down wave that looks like a tombstone). If a STEMI is suspected after an ECG is performed, the patient should be started on a second antiplatelet agent (e.g., ticagrelor), heparin, and sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\nNable et al. review the typical electrophysiologic changes found in STEMI. The authors note that T-wave inversions and ST-segment depression can before, during, or after the STEMI event. The authors recommend obtaining serial ECGs in patients with suspected STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates hyperacute T waves (blue arrows) that are only occurring in a vascular distribution (V2-V6).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia can present with peaked T waves; however, peaked T waves would be demonstrated in all leads. Other findings of hyperkalemia can include QRS widening. Immediate management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes should include calcium administration followed by drugs that shift potassium intracellularly such as insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate. Further management may include diuresis and/or dialysis.\n\nAnswer B: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may demonstrate increased voltages throughout the ECG, in particular, in leads V2-V6 with deep Q waves in the septal leads. It may present with syncope upon exertion in a young patient (and in rare cases, sudden cardiac death). Ultrasound would show hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Management involves staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activities, and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Hypokalemia can present initially on ECG with U waves and may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias. Repletion with potassium is the preferred treatment, and the magnesium level should be checked as low magnesium can lead to potassium wasting in the kidneys.\n\nAnswer E: Pericarditis presents with chest pain worse by laying back and relieved by leaning forward. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions, and echocardiography may demonstrate a pericardial effusion. Management involves the administration of ibuprofen or colchicine and steroids in refractory cases. However, these therapies should not be used after myocardial infarction.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHyperacute T waves are an early finding that is concerning for myocardial infarction.",

Supportive care is the most appropriate management strategy for patients with viral meningitis.\n\nAseptic (viral) meningitis presents similarly to bacterial meningitis with neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, malaise, and flu-like symptoms. Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose. CSF should be sent for Gram stain and culture to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial meningitis.

It presents as acute onset, painless vision loss, normally in one eye. On fundoscopic exam, classic findings of this disease include venous engorgement, retinal hemorrhage, cotton wool exudates, and edema/swelling of the optic disk can be seen. There is no definitive treatment for this disorder but symptomatic treatment includes intravitreal glucocorticoid injections and retinal laser photocoagulation. Retinal vein occlusion may resolve spontaneously or progress to permanent vision loss.\n\nRobinson and Halpern present evidence regarding the treatment of retinal vein occlusion.

In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin. It can more accurately characterize if a stroke occurred, and the extent of the injury.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe workup of a transient ischemic attack should be centered on a thorough neurological exam, a non-contrast CT scan of the head, and administration of aspirin assuming there is no intracranial bleed.",

            "Step 1: Analyze the patient\u2019s presentation. The patient is one day postpartum after a vaginal twin delivery. She complains of vaginal pain that has now worsened with chills and abdominal cramps, and she has a light red voluminous discharge. Although a light red lochia rubra can be physiologic in the early postpartum period, her systemic symptoms (chills, pain, cramping) in a patient with risk factors (diabetes) raise concerns for postpartum endometritis.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the laboratory results. Her labs are largely normal (leukocyte count within normal range), but postpartum endometritis can be present despite near-normal labs early in the course.\n\nStep 3: Compare treatment options.

        "reason": "Based on the presence of both hemoglobin (Hb) A and S on gel electrophoresis, this patient has sickle cell trait. Episodes of painless hematuria are commonly seen in these patients.\n\nSickle cell trait is a condition that refers to carrying 1 normal and 1 abnormal beta-globin allele. On electrophoresis, this will present as 3 different bands consisting of about 50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin). HbF decreases significantly after the first 6 weeks of life. Individuals with sickle cell trait tend to be asymptomatic and do not have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population. However, they are at higher risk of some conditions. Patients are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous physical activity and may have episodic painless hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis. The hyperosmolar, acidotic, and hypoxic environment of the renal medulla is thought to trigger red cell sickling which results in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. Patients with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. These patients should receive reproductive counseling and use appropriate preventive measures to prevent dehydration during intensive exercise.\n\nHulsizer et al. studied the association between sickle cell trait and common medical conditions using insurance claims data. The authors found that sickle cell trait is associated with increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and retinopathy. The authors recommend further evaluation of these associations using prospective studies derived from clinical data.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows gel electrophoresis with an example of a normal (95-98% HbA and < 2% HbF), sickle cell trait (50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF), and sickle cell anemia (85-95% HbS and 5-15% HbF) patient from left to right.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Diabetes has not been associated with sickle cell trait in the majority of studies.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is a complication of sickle cell anemia. Mechanisms include functional asplenism, reduced tissue perfusion during a sickle crisis, and chronic transfusions with an indwelling catheter. Common infections include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitis. Sickle cell trait is not clearly associated with an increased risk of infection and actually confers some protection against malaria.\n\nAnswer D: Splenectomy from auto-infarction is often seen in sickle cell anemia, but it is rare with sickle cell trait. In sickle cell anemia, splenic sequestration of sickled red blood cells causes infarction, leading to progressive atrophy and functional hyposplenism. Most individuals with sickle cell disease are functionally asplenic by age 2 to 4. The spleen subsequently cannot phagocytose encapsulated organisms properly, which predisposes sickle cell patients to infection.\n\nAnswer E: Stroke is a complication of sickle cell anemia but not sickle cell trait. This is due to the increased viscosity of the blood and reduced deformability of red cells in patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSickle cell trait is associated with episodes of painless hematuria.",

        "reason": "This young, healthy patient is presenting with constant vertigo, ataxia, vomiting, and a head impulse test revealing a corrective saccade, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) exam, which suggests a peripheral etiology of vertigo, most likely vestibular neuritis. As the diagnosis can be made clinically, steroids are the only treatment needed.\n\nDifferentiating peripheral (the vestibular system) versus central (the brain) vertigo is critical in management. Peripheral vertigo is commonly caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Vertigo that is constant is more consistent with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis but could also be a cerebellar stroke. To differentiate, age, risk factors, and onset of symptoms are critical. Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam. They note how it can be used to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo. It is recommended to perform this exam when differentiating central versus peripheral vertigo.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 3: Head imaging such as a CT head or MRI brain is not necessary in patients with a clear peripheral cause of their vertigo/dizziness with a HINTS exam suggesting a peripheral etiology. Clinically, this patient has vestibular neuritis and can be treated accordingly. Imaging would be needed if the patient had an acute cerebellar stroke.\n\nAnswer D: The Epley maneuver is only indicated in cases of benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo, which presents with severe vertigo (with changes in head position) that diminish with time and keeping the head stationary. Note that this patient\u2019s Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative and that his vertigo is constant rather than intermittent or positional.\n\nAnswer E: Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated within 4.5 hours in the setting of an ischemic stroke after a head CT rules out a head bleed, other reversible causes are treated, and assuming there are no contraindications to thrombolytics. Tissue plasminogen activator can be given in posterior circulation strokes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPeripheral causes of vertigo generally do not require head imaging, and causes such as labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis can be treated with steroids.",

            "Step 1: Gather relevant information. The patient is a 33-year-old man with constant vertigo (room spinning), ataxia, vomiting, and rightward nystagmus. The symptoms did not change with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (which is more suggestive of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). A key exam finding is that the head impulse test elicits a corrective saccade, which strongly points to a peripheral process, such as vestibular neuritis, rather than a central cause (where the head impulse test is usually normal).\n\nStep 2: Compare and eliminate incorrect choices.\n\u2022 CT head (Option A): This imaging study is useful for ruling out a hemorrhage or mass, but in this young patient with exam findings of a peripheral cause, CT head is not the most appropriate next step.\n\u2022 Epley maneuver (Option B): This maneuver is indicated for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; however, BPPV typically causes brief episodes of vertigo that are positional. In this case, the vertigo is constant.\n\u2022 MRI brain (Option C): While MRI is the gold standard to evaluate for posterior circulation strokes in cases of acute vestibular syndrome, the exam findings (positive head impulse test without skew deviation) favor a peripheral etiology, making central causes less likely.\n\u2022 Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (Option E): tPA is used in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Given the clinical presentation and exam findings that suggest a peripheral process (vestibular neuritis), tPA is not indicated.\n\nStep 3: Choose the appropriate management. In vestibular neuritis, treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone) is recommended to reduce inflammation and improve recovery.\n\nFinal answer: Prednisone (Option D).",
            "Step 1: The patient's symptoms (constant room spinning, vomiting, ataxia) along with physical exam findings (rightward nystagmus, an abnormal head impulse test with a corrective saccade, and no skew deviation) point toward a peripheral cause of vertigo. Specifically, these findings are consistent with vestibular neuritis.\n\nStep 2: The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is employed to diagnose benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), but the patient\u2019s dizziness is unchanged by this maneuver, making BPPV unlikely. A positive head impulse test (with corrective saccade) further supports a peripheral vestibulopathy rather than a central process. In the context of these findings, intracranial imaging (CT head or MRI brain) and thrombolytic therapy (tPA) are not warranted.\n\nStep 3: For vestibular neuritis, the appropriate management is supportive care, including antiemetic therapy and vestibular suppressants in the acute phase. In addition, corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) have been shown to improve outcomes by reducing inflammation of the vestibular nerve.\n\nFinal Answer: D. Prednisone",

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after a myocardial infarction for a follow-up appointment. The most appropriate next step in management is to start an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as lisinopril.\n\nWhen a patient experiences a myocardial infarction, there are certain medications that the patient should be started on that lower mortality. These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced. Of note, ACE inhibitors also reduce mortality in diabetes by decreasing hyperfiltration damage to the glomeruli.\n\nJering et al. hypothesized that using an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor would improve mortality in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction. They discuss how an ACE inhibitor is the standard of care in patients currently. They recommend performing a randomized controlled trial comparing these treatment modalities.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an ECG with ST elevation (red circles) in leads II, III, and AVF. These ST elevations are indicative of a STEMI.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hydrochlorothiazide can be used to manage this patient's blood pressure; however, this drug does not lower mortality like an ACE inhibitor. In the setting of patients with myocardial infarctions, inhibition of detrimental ventricular remodeling is key for lowering mortality.\n\nAnswer C: Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to reduce blood pressure; however, it does not reduce mortality in patients who have experienced an MI. Calcium channel blockers tend to have few side effects and can be safely started in most patients.\n\nAnswer D: Continuing current medications and scheduling a follow-up appointment misses the opportunity for the patient to be started on a mortality-lowering ACE inhibitor. In patients who are amenable to starting a new medication, an ACE inhibitor should be administered to all patients who have sustained an MI.\n\nAnswer E: Switching to carvedilol would be unnecessary and not likely to benefit this patient as much as adding an ACE inhibitor. Metoprolol is the preferred beta blocker in patients who have sustained an MI. In the absence of idiosyncratic side effects, there is no indication to use another beta blocker.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients who have experienced a myocardial infarction should be discharged on mortality-lowering drugs such as aspirin, beta-blockers, anti-platelet agents, and ACE inhibitors.",

Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection. The spirochete leads to disease in the posterior columns (vibration and proprioception sensation). Patients present with sensory ataxia (similar to subacute combined degeneration), lancinating pain (in the limbs, back, or face), and an Argyll-Robertson pupil (impaired pupillary constriction to light but intact pupillary constriction to accommodation).\n\nAnswer C: Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin are seen in patients with major depressive disorder which does not cause sensory ataxia with brisk reflexes.\n\nAnswer E: Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose would result in hypothyroidism, which can present with depressed mood, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Roux-en-Y is an effective means of losing weight, and as the body mass decreases with weight loss, the required dose of levothyroxine is decreased. It would not present with the abnormal neurologic findings seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRoux-en-Y bariatric surgery increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency via reduction of food intake, decreased functional parietal cell count, and reduced absorption of vitamin B12 (which may cause subacute combined degeneration).",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a pattern of chest pain (pressure and diaphoresis) that is highly concerning for an acute myocardial infarction. This patient initially has ST depressions (in triage) followed by ST segment normalization and possibly hyperacute T waves which raises concern for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring frequent ECGs to determine if a STEMI evolves.\n\nA STEMI presents with crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among many other possible presentations. When a patient presents with symptoms concerning for a STEMI, aspirin should be administered and an ECG should be performed. Early in a myocardial infarction, ST depressions with hyperacute T waves may be present. As the infarction evolves, the T waves may become more acute and the ST segment will begin to elevate. There may be a brief period of pseudonormalization where the ST segment appears to be normal. If the patient appears better, this can be reassuring. However, ongoing chest pain in the setting of these findings raises concern for pseudonormalization of the ST segment (an ST segment that is going to continue to rise). Nitroglycerin can be administered to see if the patient can become chest pain-free, and serial ECGs should be performed to determine if a STEMI is present. If symptoms resolve and the ECG is stable, this is reassuring and medical optimization and an elective catheterization may be performed. If the ECG evolves into a STEMI, then cardiac catheterization is indicated emergently.\n\nDaga et al. discuss STEMI and its workup. They note the ECG manifestations, and the pathophysiology in addition to the appropriate workup of acute coronary syndrome. They recommend aspirin and catheterization in an acute STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an initial ECG with ST depression (blue arrows) followed by pseudonormalization of the ST segment (green arrows) and possibly hyperacute T waves (black arrows), which are concerning for ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac catheterization may be required in this patient; however, if the patient\u2019s chest pain improves or if the troponin is negative, it is unlikely he is having an acute myocardial infarction requiring immediate catheterization. Repeating the ECG will allow for triaging of the patient and will aid in determining if emergency cardiac catheterization is needed.\n\nAnswer B: Chest radiography is appropriate in the workup of chest pain as it can rule out diagnoses such as pneumothorax or may suggest diagnoses such as an aortic dissection (type A) if there is a widened mediastinum. In this patient, the ST segment changes and characteristic history make acute coronary syndrome a more likely diagnosis, and while a chest radiograph should be performed at some point, repeating the ECG is a more dire initial step in management.\n\nAnswer C: CK-MB level could be helpful in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred as it elevates rapidly and also decreases fairly rapidly. This makes it useful when diagnosing a new myocardial infarction after a recent infarction as the troponin may still be elevated from the previous infarction. This patient has no history of recent myocardial infarction, and a repeat ECG is more dire to determine if this patient needs emergent intervention. Of note, the decision for emergent catheterization should not wait on cardiac biomarkers.\n\nAnswer D: Heparin should not be given empirically to patients in chest pain. It does not necessarily decrease mortality but does increase the risk of bleeding. It is often given to patients with an NSTEMI.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPseudonormalization occurs when an ST depression begins to elevate and appears normal in the setting of a myocardial infarction, requiring close monitoring and serial ECGs to ensure that a ST elevation myocardial infarction does not occur.",

In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are often a better initial drug in depression than SSRIs in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSansone and Sansone discuss SNRIs and their uses. They discuss how there are different efficacies and propensities of the different SNRIs. They recommend choosing an appropriate SNRI based on the patient's needs and comorbidities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression in patients who also suffer from other neuropathic pain conditions or conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred. A TCA might be appropriate if the patient had already failed other first-line agents.\n\nAnswer B: Bupropion is a weight-neutral antidepressant that can be used in smoking cessation and patients who are trying to avoid the sexual side effects of SSRIs (anorgasmia). It would not address this patient's diabetic neuropathy, though it could be beneficial for his obesity.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is an SSRI that could be used first-line for major depressive disorder. However, if a patient has a concomitant condition, it is better to choose a single agent that addresses both problems; thus, SNRIs are better first-line medications in this patient with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer D: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that can be used in atypical depression or as a third-line or later agent in the management of depression. This agent can cause a hypertensive crisis in the setting of tyramine consumption, has many medication interactions, and a long washout period. Thus, it is not usually a first or second-line agent. However, it is highly effective in patients who have failed other first-line agents and should still be used in appropriate candidates.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSNRIs are appropriate first-line agents for major depressive disorder in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).",

This is a classic sign of myoglobinuria.\n\u2022 Together, these findings point to heat stroke with subsequent rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown).\n\nStep 2: Understand Rhabdomyolysis and Its Laboratory Findings\n\u2022 Rhabdomyolysis causes the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream.\n\u2022 Muscle breakdown leads to:\n\u2003\u2013 Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CK)\n\u2003\u2013 Release of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid\n\u2003\u2013 An early drop in serum calcium (hypocalcemia) because calcium moves into damaged muscle tissue\n\u2022 Although hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperuricemia may also be seen, the hallmark early electrolyte abnormality in rhabdomyolysis is hypocalcemia.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate Incorrect Options\n\u2022 Hyperkalemia \u2013 Common in rhabdomyolysis but can be variable and is often a later, life\u2010threatening complication.\n\u2022 Hyperphosphatemia \u2013 Can be seen but is less characteristic for initial laboratory findings.\n\u2022 Hyperuricemia \u2013 May occur due to increased purine breakdown.\n\u2022 Hyponatremia \u2013 Not typically a primary abnormality in this context.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the Most Likely Laboratory Abnormality\n\u2022 Early in the course of rhabdomyolysis, the calcium is sequestered in the injured muscle, leading to hypocalcemia.

The patient\u2019s high temperature, tachycardia, and altered mental status after exertion suggest heat stroke.\n2. The positive urine dipstick for blood, despite the absence of actual red blood cells, points toward myoglobinuria, which occurs when muscle breakdown releases myoglobin.\n3.

The most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm this syndrome is electromyography.\n\nSmall cell lung cancer presents with fatigue, weight loss, cough, and a coin lesion on chest radiograph typically in a smoker. A common paraneoplastic syndrome in small cell lung cancer is Lambert-Eaton syndrome which presents with muscle weakness that improves with activity and worsens with rest. Activity improves symptoms due to accumulation of calcium with exercise which allows for acetylcholine release. This occurs secondary to antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels which decrease acetylcholine release. The diagnosis of Lambert Eaton syndrome can be confirmed with electromyography. Treatment includes addressing the underlying lung tumor.\n\nKesner et al. review the diagnosis and etiology of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. They discuss how this disease is associated with lung cancer. They recommend making the diagnosis using electrophysiologic studies.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a chest radiograph with a coin lesion in the left lung field (red circle). This finding is suggestive of small cell lung cancer.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood laboratory tests could assess for multidrug resistance 1 protein (MDR-1 aka P-glycoprotein or ABCB1) which predicts resistance to chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer; however, it would not further elucidate this patient's muscle weakness.\n\nAnswers 2 & 4: CT scan of the chest and lung biopsy would further elucidate this patient's small cell lung cancer; however, it would not explain his weakness that improves with activity. In the setting of an elderly smoker with fatigue and weight loss and a coin lesion, the diagnosis of lung cancer is essentially established.\n\nAnswer E: Muscle biopsy would be the most accurate diagnostic test for dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis; however, it would not assess for conditions such as myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome.\n\nBullet Summary:\nElectromyography is the diagnostic test of choice for Lambert-Eaton syndrome.",

TCA overdose typically presents with anticholinergic effects, which include urinary retention, dry mouth, mydriasis (dilated pupils), and decreased bowel sounds, along with the arrhythmogenic changes noted on the ECG.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate incorrect options.\n\u2022 Diaphoresis \u2013 TCA overdose usually produces dry skin rather than sweating (anticholinergic effect).\n\u2022 Jaundice \u2013 There is no indication of hepatotoxicity in TCA overdose.\n\u2022 Miosis \u2013 Opioid overdose causes miosis; TCA overdose, as an anticholinergic syndrome, causes mydriasis.\n\u2022 Wheezing \u2013 Not a typical feature of TCA overdose.\n\nStep 4: Final Answer.\nGiven the expected anticholinergic toxicity in TCA overdose, urinary retention is the most likely additional finding.\n\nFinal answer: D. Urinary retention."

The patient is in the 25th percentile for height and weight which has been constant since birth. Her guardians state that the patient has normal bowel movements and has been gaining weight appropriately. The patient has a history of tricuspid stenosis. She also recently had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her chest which demonstrated dilation of her airways. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for bruises along the patient's shins which the guardians state are from playing soccer. The rest of the exam is deferred because the patient starts crying.

Dextrocardia is a common feature in this pathology, which results in right-sided heart sounds or a diastolic murmur best heard along the right lower sternal border for this patient's tricuspid stenosis.\n\nKartagener syndrome (primary ciliary dyskinesia) occurs secondary to a genetic defect in a patient's cilia. This results in a clinical picture of recurrent sinusitis, recurrent upper respiratory infections, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus (all major organs are a mirror image of where they should be). A physical exam will reveal right-sided heart sounds and a chest radiograph will demonstrate dextrocardia. Treatment is with respiratory support, assistance with mucociliary clearance, and treatment of infections.\n\nLeigh et al. review the evidence regarding the manifestations of Kartagener syndrome. They discuss how about 50% of patients have situs inversus. They recommend respiratory support for these patients given the overlap with other mucociliary clearance disorders such as cystic fibrosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Hypocalcemia would be seen in DiGeorge syndrome which presents with CATCH-22 (Cleft palate/lip, Abnormal facies, Thymic aplasia, Cardiac defects, Hypocalcemia, and chromosome 22 deletion).

        "reason": "This patient's presentation with altered mental status, pinpoint pupils, and decreased bowel sounds is most consistent with an opioid overdose. Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial. The authors found that patients who received intranasal naloxone needed a second dose of naloxone more frequently compared to patients who received intramuscular naloxone. The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration). This patient is oxygenating well, protecting his airway, and does not have profound bradypnea.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOpioid overdose presents with somnolence, pinpoint pupils, decreased bowel sounds, and bradypnea; stable patients who are adequately breathing and protecting their airway require only observation until clinically sober.",

Anal fissures lateral to the midline are associated with inflammatory and infectious etiologies; thus, further workup (testing for HIV, fecal occult blood testing, and sexually transmitted disease testing) is needed rather than merely symptomatic treatment.\n\nAnal fissures present with exquisite pain upon defecation which may lead to fecal retention and constipation. Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient\u2019s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures.

They recommend considering all modalities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis followed by an MRI may be the most appropriate testing if a perirectal abscess is suspected. These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation.

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

IRIS is a paradoxical worsening or unmasking of a previously treated infection (like TB) due to the rapid restoration of the immune response after initiation of antiretroviral therapy.

What additional clues are provided?\n\u2022 The physical exam mentions \u201cFigure A.\u201d Although we do not see the image, in this context a notable exam finding in a post\u2010catheterization patient could be characteristic skin findings such as livedo reticularis or \u201cblue toe syndrome.\u201d\n\u2022 These skin findings, along with renal dysfunction and abdominal pain, are hallmarks of cholesterol embolization syndrome (also known as atheroembolic disease), which is a known complication following instrumentation (e.g., coronary angiography).\n\nStep 3. How do the options compare?\nA. Cholesterol embolism \u2013 Often seen a few days after catheterization, can present with an acute inflammatory response. It typically affects the skin (livedo reticularis, blue toe syndrome), kidneys (rising creatinine), and sometimes the gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain). An \u201celevated\u201d but modest lipase can be seen due to associated pancreatic involvement or because of diminished clearance with renal impairment.\nB. Heart failure and reinfarction \u2013 While these complications can occur post\u2010MI, they do not account for the specific abdominal pain and the characteristic skin findings.\nC. Medication side effect \u2013 Not likely to explain the constellation of abdominal pain, skin findings, and renal dysfunction.\nD. Pancreatitis \u2013 Although the lipase is elevated, acute pancreatitis in this setting would be less likely to present with the skin findings described by Figure A or the renal dysfunction, and there is a more direct explanation that ties the overall picture together.\nE. Renal failure \u2013 The creatinine is elevated, but renal failure on its own wouldn\u2019t account for the abdominal pain and the skin exam findings.\n\nStep 4. Final answer reasoning:\nGiven the clinical context\u2014a patient post-MI (likely post-catheterization) developing abdominal pain, renal dysfunction, a modestly elevated lipase, and a physical exam finding suggestive of a cutaneous embolic phenomenon (as hinted by Figure A)\u2014the most likely underlying diagnosis is cholesterol embolism syndrome.\n\nFinal answer: A.

West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data. Therefore, the pathophysiology of West syndrome is more likely CRH-excess mediated rather than due to a deficiency of vitamin B6.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWest syndrome, which may be caused by CRH excess, presents with hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression, and infantile spasms.",

Her medical history is notable for depression, anxiety, and gonococcal urethritis that was appropriately treated. She is sexually active and does not use condoms. She admits to drinking at least 5 standard alcoholic drinks a day. The patient also recently lost a large amount of weight for a fitness show she planned on entering. The patient's current medications include oral contraceptive pills, fluoxetine, alprazolam, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and folate. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 80/40 mmHg, pulse is 110/minute, and respirations are 15/minute with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical exam, you note an athletic young woman with burly shoulders, a thick neck, and acne on her forehead and back. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness with 10/10 pain upon palpation of the right upper quadrant. Intravenous fluids are started and labs are sent. A urinary \u00df-hCG has been ordered.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with constant right upper quadrant pain in the setting of oral contraceptives (OCP) and likely anabolic steroid use, suggesting a diagnosis of a ruptured hepatic adenoma (HA). The pathophysiology of HA is vascular ectasia from exposure to OCPs and androgens.\n\nA hepatic adenoma typically occurs secondary to exposure to OCPs and androgens (anabolic steroids) causing a generalized vascular ectasia. Both of these drugs should be discontinued in patients with hepatic adenoma. Symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Sudden worsening of pain with unstable vitals suggests a ruptured hepatic adenoma. Patients should be managed with fluids and an ultrasound should be performed to support the diagnosis. Additional imaging tests include an abdominal contrast-enhanced CT to better characterize the pathologic anatomy in this disease. The definitive treatment in this disease is surgery in order to remove the hepatic adenoma. In cases of a ruptured hepatic adenomas, patients require transfusion and operative management.\n\nBioulac-Sage et al. present the current data that are available for classifying hepatic adenomas. They discuss how many of these lesions involve alterations of the HNF1A gene, the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and the CTNNB1 gene. They recommend performing molecular analysis in order to better understand which lesions are likely to undergo malignant transformation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ectopic implantation of a blastocyst (ectopic pregnancy) that has ruptured could present similarly to what this patient is experiencing. Symptoms would include lower abdominal pain and unstable vitals. However, this patient's pain is more pronounced in the right upper quadrant and is occurring in the setting of OCP and possible anabolic steroid use.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation of the pancreas represents a diagnosis of pancreatitis. This would present with epigastric pain after a fatty meal or alcohol consumption. Though this patient does drink more than recommended and should be counseled to reduce her consumption, the pain began after exercising at the gym and there are no other symptoms of pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer C: Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein causes Budd-Chiari syndrome, which presents with a non-specific triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly in the setting of a hypercoagulable state (factor V Leiden, polycythemia vera, OCP use, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). Though this patient has risk factors for this pathology, they do not have any classic symptoms.\n\nAnswer D: Obstruction of the common bile duct with radio-opaque stones would present with colicky right upper quadrant pain in a patient that is \"fat, female, fertile, and forty.\" Though the pain presented in this case is localized to the right upper quadrant, it is not colicky and there is not a positive Murphy sign described. OCP's are a risk factor for cholesterol stones as are rapid weight loss, both of which this patient has. This is a strong possibility on the differential; however, the symptoms presented suggest a diagnosis of ruptured hepatic adenoma given the demographics of the patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA hepatic adenoma presents with right upper quadrant pain in the setting of OCP and/or androgen use and can rupture leading to unstable vitals.",

These findings raise the suspicion that she may be using anabolic steroids, a clue that her physique and skin findings are not entirely natural.\n\n\u2022 An important association is that use of anabolic steroids (and OCPs in some cases) predisposes to the formation of benign hepatic tumors such as hepatic adenomas.

Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein  \n\u2003\u2013 This is describing Budd\u2010Chiari syndrome. Although it is associated with OCP use, the typical presentation is a subacute development of RUQ pain with hepatomegaly and ascites. It would not account for the sudden severe pain with frank hypotension that suggests hemorrhage.\n\nD. Obstruction of the common bile duct by radio\u2010opaque stones  \n\u2003\u2013 This is a picture of choledocholithiasis. While RUQ pain is seen with biliary pathologies, these usually present with biliary colic or cholecystitis; they do not typically cause a sudden shock state unless complicated by cholangitis, and even then, the overall picture does not match.\n\nE.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after trauma to his finger with a subungual hematoma. Given that he has no other associated injuries, trephination is the only management indicated.\n\nA subungual hematoma occurs after trauma to the finger leading to a collection of blood under the fingernail. Depending on the mechanism, this can be associated with a distal phalanx fracture. Evaluation for a fracture should include a thorough history, exam, and radiography. If there are no other signs of injury including nailbed dislocation or an open fracture, then management requires only trephination (putting a hole in the nail to allow blood to drain) as this alleviates pressure on the nailbed matrix thus preventing possible irreversible damage.\n\nRsoer et al. compare nail bed repair to nail trephination for subungual hematomas in children. The authors find that there was no difference in complications or outcomes between nail bed repair and trephination; however, the cost in the nail trephination group was lower. The authors recommend nail trephination for children with a subungual hematoma and an intact nail and nail margin.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows the physical exam finding of a subungual hematoma with a collection of blood underneath the fingernail bed (green circle).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Excision and histological examination could be appropriate management of melanoma, which may present under the fingernails with a hyperpigmented, irregular skin lesion, or a \u201cbarcode\u201d appearance if it is at the base of the nail. A spontaneous subungual hematoma could be suggestive of melanoma; however, in the setting of trauma, it is a much less likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer B: Fingernail removal should only be performed if there is also nail avulsion or nail fold disruption to allow for inspection of the nail bed and repair of any laceration. Failure to repair a nailbed laceration could lead to permanent deformity of the fingernail when it regrows.\n\nAnswer C: Observation is inappropriate as the accumulation of blood under the nail in a subungual hematoma could lead to ischemia and permanent injury to the nailbed.

The most appropriate next step is to repeat HIV serology and immediately initiate triple antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir.\n\nHealthcare exposures to HIV are divided into 2 categories based on the level of contact with the source patient. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions, immediate prophylaxis is recommended. This category also includes all needlestick exposures. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s urine, feces, or bodily secretions, prophylaxis is not recommended. If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects.

The patient\u2019s serology at the time of exposure must be established to compare to future testing. Despite her previous negative serology and low-risk lifestyle, it would still be best to repeat the testing at the same time prophylactic treatment is initiated.\n\nAnswer B: Perform genotype testing on source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to results is incorrect because this option would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Empiric treatment with a triple antiretroviral drug combination is appropriate for all patients with high-risk exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Waiting to hear that the medical student\u2019s HIV serology is negative would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Triple antiretroviral drug treatment should be initiated without waiting for the results. Empiric treatment of all patients with high-risk exposure is recommended in all cases.\n\nAnswer D: Waiting for the results of the medical student\u2019s serology would delay treatment for her exposure.

            "Step 1: Identify key clinical findings.  \n\u2022 The patient is a 26-year-old woman who is 7 weeks from her last menstrual period presenting with vaginal bleeding and worsening lower abdominal pain.  \n\u2022 She uses a copper intrauterine device, which is associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy if conception occurs.  \n\u2022 Vital signs indicate instability (BP 79/50 mmHg, pulse 135/min), suggesting possible hemorrhage.  \n\u2022 Laboratory studies show a beta-hCG level of 2,700 IU/L, which is consistent with early pregnancy.  \n\nStep 2: Formulate the likely diagnosis.  \nConsidering the presentation (pain, bleeding, hemodynamic instability) and the history (IUD use) in the context of early pregnancy, an ectopic pregnancy\u2014possibly ruptured\u2014is highly likely.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the options.  \nA. CT of the abdomen and pelvis \u2013 Not ideal; CT is not first-line in suspected ectopic pregnancy due to radiation exposure and decreased utility in evaluating early pregnancies.  \nB. Laparoscopy \u2013 While surgical intervention might eventually be required in a ruptured ectopic, the diagnosis must be confirmed quickly before proceeding to surgery.  \nC. Methotrexate therapy \u2013 Used for stable, unruptured ectopic pregnancies. This patient\u2019s hemodynamic instability and signs of possible rupture preclude its use.  \nD. Repeat beta-hCG in 48 hours \u2013 Not appropriate in a hemodynamically unstable patient. Serial beta-hCG measurements are used in stable patients when the diagnosis is unclear.  \nE. Transvaginal ultrasound \u2013 The most appropriate initial imaging modality to confirm the location of the pregnancy and the presence of any intra-abdominal hemorrhage, especially in candidates for ectopic pregnancy.\n\nStep 4: Final answer.  \nBased on the above reasoning, the most appropriate next step in management is to obtain a transvaginal ultrasound (Option E).",
            "Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The patient is a 26-year-old woman at approximately 7 weeks gestation who presents with vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. Importantly, she is hemodynamically unstable (blood pressure 79/50 mmHg and pulse 135/min) and has laboratory evidence of blood loss (hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL). These findings raise immediate concern for a potentially ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\n\n2. The patient uses a copper intrauterine device. While IUDs are highly effective at preventing intrauterine pregnancies, if pregnancy does occur, it is more likely to be extrauterine (ectopic).\n\n3. The critical next step in management is to rapidly confirm the source of bleeding. Even though the patient is unstable and being resuscitated with IV fluids, the diagnosis is not confirmed without imaging.\n\n4. Among the options:\n   - CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Option A) is not the ideal first-line imaging modality in a suspected pregnancy-related emergency.\n   - Laparoscopy (Option B) is a surgical intervention and may be required if the patient has a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, but prior confirmation with imaging is essential.\n   - Methotrexate therapy (Option C) is reserved for stable patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancies.\n   - Repeating beta-hCG in 48 hours (Option D) is part of the evaluation for ectopic pregnancy in stable patients but not appropriate in an acutely unstable patient.\n   - Transvaginal ultrasound (Option E) is the diagnostic test of choice in suspected ectopic pregnancy because it can quickly help distinguish between an intrauterine and an ectopic pregnancy, even when the beta-hCG level is below the discriminatory zone (typically around 1,500\u20132,000 IU/L).\n\n5. Given the patient\u2019s unstable state and the concern for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, the best and most immediate next step is to perform a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis quickly so that appropriate surgical intervention can be pursued if needed.\n\nFinal Answer: E. Transvaginal ultrasound",
            "Step 1: This patient, with a history of a 7-week amenorrhea and use of a copper IUD, presents with vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. Her vital signs reveal hemodynamic instability (hypotension and tachycardia), which is concerning for an intra-abdominal hemorrhage.\n\nStep 2: The laboratory results (hCG of 2,700 IU/L) and clinical picture are suspicious for an ectopic pregnancy. In a hemodynamically unstable patient with this presentation, a ruptured ectopic pregnancy is highly likely, which requires prompt surgical intervention.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the options:\n\u2022 Option A (CT of the abdomen and pelvis) is not the diagnostic tool of choice in pregnancy and delays treatment.\n\u2022 Option B (Laparoscopy) provides a minimally invasive means for surgical management and is appropriate for a patient with a suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\n\u2022 Option C (Methotrexate therapy) is only suitable for stable patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancies and low hCG levels.\n\u2022 Option D (Repeat beta-hCG in 48 hours) is used in stable patients to assess viability, not in a destabilized patient.\n\u2022 Option E (Transvaginal ultrasound) is helpful for the diagnosis in stable patients, but in a hemodynamically unstable patient, immediate intervention is indicated rather than further imaging.\n\nStep 4: Considering her instability, the most appropriate next step in management is immediate surgical intervention.\n\nFinal Answer: B.

        "reason": "This patient presents with episodic epigastric pain and nausea that improves with the consumption of food, which suggests a diagnosis of a duodenal ulcer. Duodenal ulcers are often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a urease-producing organism.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions and defects in the mucosal lining of the small intestines that allow for damage to the underlying tissues. Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori. If the patient tests positive for H. pylori infection, treatment involves triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor. Patients who fail to improve should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\n\nCiociola et al. studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers. They found that about many had confirmed infections. They recommend against empiric treatment without prior confirmation of infection.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Crypt abscesses are found on histology in ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis presents with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients can also experience musculoskeletal pain, uveitis, and dermatologic findings such as erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum. Treatment may include mesalazine.\n\nAnswer B: A mucosal defect in the stomach is the pathologic description of a gastric ulcer. This patient\u2019s presentation of epigastric pain that improves with the consumption of food is more consistent with an ulcer in the duodenum. Treatment of a gastric ulcer may include proton pump inhibitors.\n\nAnswer C: Noncaseating granulomas are found on histology in Crohn disease. This patient denies any diarrhea (often associated with pain), which is the primary feature of Crohn disease. Other findings include abscesses, fistulas, and strictures. Treatment may include mesalamine and infliximab.\n\nAnswer D: PAS-positive material is found in the lamina propria on small intestinal biopsy in Whipple disease. In addition to abdominal pain, Whipple disease is characterized by diarrhea with flatulence and steatorrhea, fever, arthralgias, and weight loss. Treatment is with ceftriaxone or penicillin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDuodenal ulcers typically present with episodic epigastric abdominal that is improved after eating and are associated with H. pylori infection.",

The most common symptoms are Raynaud phenomenon (vascular hyper-reactivity that presents with burning/pain in the hands where the hands change color from white to blue to red, seen in Figure A), arthralgias, myalgias, dysphagia, and edema of the hands. Anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein antibodies are commonly found in mixed connective tissue disease and are a specific marker. In this disease, there is typically an absence of renal involvement. Treatment involves steroids as well as calcium channel blockers for symptomatic control of Raynaud phenomenon.\n\nBatu et al. review the evidence regarding patients with mixed connective tissue disease.

Supportive care is the most appropriate management strategy for patients with viral meningitis.\n\nAseptic (viral) meningitis presents similarly to bacterial meningitis with neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, malaise, and flu-like symptoms. Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose. CSF should be sent for Gram stain and culture to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial meningitis.

The most appropriate treatment for these conditions is valproic acid.\n\nAbsence seizures classically present with cessation of motor activity and speech with a blank facial expression and occasionally automatisms such as flickering of the eyelids. They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile. They recommend using valproic acid if there are concurrent seizure conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Carbamazepine would be the appropriate therapy for a partial seizure (tonic or clonic movements in addition to an absence of a post-ictal period) or for trigeminal neuralgia (sudden pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve). It would not address both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nAnswer B: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a useful treatment that helps a patient develop coping strategies and change unhelpful patterns of thought. It could be useful if this girl was having trouble focusing in school for another reason (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder); however, it is not useful in managing seizures.\n\nAnswer C: Ethosuximide is the most appropriate initial therapy for absence seizures. In this patient, she is suffering from both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which could not be treated by ethosuximide alone, in contrast to valproic acid which could treat both conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic that can also be used as a mood stabilizer. It carries the potentially severe side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is not a first-line treatment for absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Stevens-Johnson syndrome will present with painful desquamation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAbsence seizures present with periods of inattentiveness and subtle automatisms and are most appropriately treated with ethosuximide or with valproic acid if there is concurrent juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.",

IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV.

            "Step 1 \u2013 Recognize the scenario:\n\u2022 The patient, an HIV-positive 31-year-old man, originally presented with active pulmonary infection (likely tuberculosis given the right upper lobe infiltrate, his low CD4 count of 40/mm\u00b3, and his high HIV viral load) and was appropriately treated.\n\u2022 Four weeks after treatment initiation, his immune status improved markedly (CD4 >400/mm\u00b3, viral load negligible). Now he has new pulmonary findings (nodules in the left upper lobe and hilar adenopathy) with systemic symptoms.\n\u2022 This presentation is consistent with Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), where the recovering immune system mounts a renewed inflammatory response against existing infections.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Eliminate incorrect options:\nA. Continue current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies \u2013 This is the recommended management in IRIS, where continuation of current therapies prevents deterioration and allows the immune system to gradually control the infection.\nB. Determine drug sensitivities \u2013 While resistance is a consideration in treatment failure, the immune reconstitution picture here is classic for IRIS rather than a new resistant infection.\nC. Discontinue antimicrobial treatment \u2013 Stopping treatment could allow the underlying infection to re-emerge and is contraindicated in IRIS.\nD. Obtain a D-dimer level \u2013 This would be unnecessary unless there was suspicion for a pulmonary embolism, which is not supported by the clinical presentation.\nE. Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy \u2013 Although steroids might be used in severe cases of IRIS to reduce inflammation, discontinuing antiretroviral therapy is not recommended.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Final Answer:\nThe most appropriate next step is to continue the current antiretroviral, antimicrobial, and antituberculoid treatments as the patient\u2019s new findings are due to IRIS.\n\nFinal answer: A. Continue current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies",
            "Step 1: Identify the scenario. This patient has a history of HIV with a low CD4 count and active tuberculosis (TB) treated about 5 weeks ago. Recently, after starting treatment, his immune status improved substantially (CD4 count from 40 to over 400), while his HIV viral load became negligible. Now, he presents with fever, cough, and new pulmonary findings (nodules in the left upper lobe and hilar adenopathy).\n\nStep 2: Recognize the diagnosis. The timing and new pulmonary findings following immune recovery are consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is a paradoxical worsening of symptoms among patients recovering immune function, often seen after initiation of antiretroviral therapy in those with TB.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the management options.\n\u2022 Option A: Continue current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies. This is the appropriate management for IRIS, where treatment is continued rather than stopped or modified.\n\u2022 Option B: Determine drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection. While sensitivity testing can be useful in certain scenarios, the clinical picture here points towards IRIS, not a new drug-resistant infection.\n\u2022 Option C: Discontinue antimicrobial treatment. Discontinuing TB or antimicrobial therapy is not recommended in the setting of IRIS.\n\u2022 Option D: Obtain a D-dimer level. This is not directly relevant to the suspected IRIS process.\n\u2022 Option E: Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy. High-dose steroids may be considered in severe IRIS, but discontinuing antiretroviral therapy is not advised as the benefits of ART outweigh the risks, and glucocorticoids should be reserved for severe cases only.\n\nStep 4: Select the best answer. The correct answer is:\nA. Continue current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies."

            "Step 1: Identify the Key Clinical Findings\n\u2022 The patient is a 57\u2010year\u2010old woman with a 6\u2010month history of progressive weakness.\n\u2022 She reports symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and weight gain.\n\u2022 On examination, she has significant proximal muscle weakness (2/5 strength in both upper and lower extremities).\n\u2022 There is a rash on her face and arms.\n\u2022 She also exhibits sparse fine hair.\n\u2022 A muscle biopsy has been performed (the image, though not shown here, is likely to show characteristic findings).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the Differential Diagnosis Options\nA. Dermatomyositis \u2013 Typically presents with symmetrical proximal muscle weakness and skin findings (such as a heliotrope rash over the eyelids and Gottron papules on the hands/arms). It is an inflammatory myopathy with characteristic biopsy findings (perifascicular atrophy, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, and complement deposition).\n\nB. Hypokalemia \u2013 Can cause muscle weakness, but usually presents acutely and does not cause a rash or chronic myopathic changes on biopsy.\n\nC. Hypothyroidism \u2013 Can lead to fatigue, weight gain, depression, and myalgias with proximal muscle weakness, as well as changes in hair texture. However, it typically does not cause a distinct rash on the face and arms, and the muscle biopsy findings in hypothyroid myopathy are not as specific as those seen in an inflammatory myositis.\n\nD. Inclusion Body Myositis \u2013 Occurs in older individuals (more common in men), with both proximal and distal weakness and sometimes dysphagia, but it lacks the classic cutaneous findings.\n\nE. Polymyositis \u2013 Presents with proximal muscle weakness without associated skin manifestations.\n\nStep 3: Synthesize the Findings\n\u2022 The presence of a rash on the face and arms is the key distinguishing feature for an inflammatory myopathy with cutaneous involvement.\n\u2022 The muscle biopsy (presumably showing perifascicular atrophy and inflammatory infiltrates) strongly supports an inflammatory process.\n\u2022 Although some of her systemic symptoms (weight gain, depression, sparse hair) could be seen in hypothyroidism, the rash and the biopsy findings point away from it.\n\nStep 4: Final Answer\nThe most likely explanation for this patient's presentation is dermatomyositis.\n\nFinal answer: A. Dermatomyositis",
            "Step 1: Gather patient details. The 57\u2010year-old woman presents with chronic weakness (rated 2/5 in proximal muscles), weight gain, depression, and changes in hair quality (sparse fine hair). She also has a rash on her face and arms. Although the patient has diabetes and has experienced hypoglycemia from missed meals, these are likely not central to the current presentation. Her recent ear infection treated with antibiotics (and a rash that might have been an allergic reaction) is also a distractor.\n\nStep 2: Analyze clinical features and compare to options.  \n\u2022 Dermatomyositis (Option A) typically presents with proximal muscle weakness and an associated rash (heliotrope rash on the eyelids and Gottron papules on the extensor surfaces). However, it usually occurs with associated systemic findings, and weight gain and the hair changes described are not characteristic.  \n\u2022 Hypokalemia (Option B) might contribute to muscle weakness, but it does not explain weight gain, depression, or the skin/hair changes.  \n\u2022 Hypothyroidism (Option C) is known to cause a myopathy that can result in proximal muscle weakness, weight gain, fatigue, and depression. Additionally, hypothyroidism can cause hair loss (sparse or coarse hair) and even skin changes.  \n\u2022 Inclusion body myositis (Option D) normally affects older males and is distinguished by a gradual onset and involvement of both proximal and distal muscles without a rash.  \n\u2022 Polymyositis (Option E) causes proximal muscle weakness but lacks the dermatologic findings (rash) as well as the weight gain and hair changes seen in this patient.\n\nStep 3: Connect findings with a unifying explanation.  \nThis patient\u2019s constellation of symptoms\u2014fatigue, weight gain, depression, proximal muscle weakness, and hair changes\u2014points toward an endocrinologic etiology, specifically hypothyroidism. The rash on her face and arms could represent associated skin changes from myxedema rather than a primary inflammatory myopathy. The muscle biopsy provided (though not described in detail here) would be consistent with hypothyroid myopathy, which often shows type II fiber atrophy without inflammatory infiltrates seen in conditions like polymyositis or dermatomyositis.\n\nFinal Answer: C. Hypothyroidism",
            "Let\u2019s break down the case:\n\n\u2022 The patient is a 57\u2010year\u2010old woman with a 6\u2010month history of progressive weakness. In addition, she reports fatigue, depression, and a 10\u2010pound weight gain. These symptoms (lethargy, weight gain, depression) are classic features of hypothyroidism.\n\n\u2022 On exam, she has markedly decreased strength (2/5 in both upper and lower extremities) and sparse, fine body hair. The sparse, brittle hair is also characteristic of hypothyroidism.\n\n\u2022 Although a rash is noted on her face and arms, this finding may be confusing. Dermatomyositis does cause a rash (e.g., heliotrope rash on the eyelids with Gottron papules on the extensor surfaces) and proximal muscle weakness. However, dermatomyositis is not typically associated with weight gain, coarse hair changes, or depression. In contrast, the constellation of weight gain, sluggishness, and hair changes strongly suggests a hypothyroid state.\n\n\u2022 The laboratory values do not reveal any electrolyte or metabolic disturbances that would primarily account for her weakness (the slightly low potassium is more likely related to her history of insulin use and hypoglycemia episodes rather than the cause of her myopathy).\n\n\u2022 The muscle biopsy (Figure A, though not shown here) is provided to support the diagnosis. In hypothyroid myopathy, one might expect to see nonspecific fiber atrophy \u2013 particularly type II fiber predominance. In contrast, inflammatory myopathies such as dermatomyositis or polymyositis would show inflammatory infiltrates, whereas inclusion body myositis has other characteristic inclusions and a different pattern of weakness.\n\nGiven the clinical picture\u2014fatigue, depression, weight gain, hair changes, and proximal myopathy\u2014the most likely explanation is hypothyroidism.\n\nFinal answer: C.

The classic conventional radiographic finding in cecal volvulus is the coffee bean sign, in which closed loops of intestine distend with gas, making visible the medial and lateral walls of dilated bowel. Diagnosis of cecal volvulus can be confirmed with a CT scan. Management involves analgesia, intravenous fluids, and surgical detorsion.\n\nHasbahceci et al. review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of cecal volvulus. The authors find that abdominal radiography has a low sensitivity for cecal volvulus. The authors recommend surgical management of cecal volvulus with resection with right hemicolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a radiograph demonstrating the \"coffee bean\" sign which is suggestive of a cecal volvulus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ileus presents after surgery or manipulation of the intestines with decreased peristalsis of the intestine leading to a failure to pass gas or have bowel movements. Treatment involves treating any electrolyte abnormalities, encouraging ambulation, and avoiding medications that decrease peristalsis (such as opioids).\n\nAnswer C: Ogilvie syndrome occurs when the colon wall is not appropriately undergoing peristalsis leading to a dilated colon with abdominal distension. It is more common in the elderly and critically ill patients. Treatment involves the placement of a rectal tube to decompress the intestines and treatment of any underlying medical conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Sigmoid volvulus is more common in elderly and critically ill patients and presents with constipation, an absence of bowel movements, and a distended, tympanitic abdomen. Although the coffee bean sign may also be seen in patients with sigmoid volvulus, patients tend to be older. In addition, plain radiography typically demonstrates multiple air-fluid levels in a sigmoid volvulus versus usually only a single air-fluid level in a cecal volvulus. Treatment involves flexible sigmoidoscopy and surgery.\n\nAnswer E: Small bowel obstruction presents with a distended and tympanitic abdomen with nausea, vomiting, and an absence of flatus or bowel movements. Radiography may demonstrate distended bowel and air-fluid levels, and the most accurate test is a CT scan of the abdomen. It occurs secondary to adhesions entrapping the bowel. Management involves the placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous fluids, and surgery.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCecal volvulus presents in younger patients with abdominal pain, distention, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and the \"coffee bean\" sign on radiography.",

            "Step 1: Consider the clinical scenario. We have a 24\u2010year\u2010old man who developed abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting toward the end of a marathon, with symptoms continuing afterward. On exam his abdomen is distended and tender, and his vital signs show tachycardia (likely from dehydration). A radiograph (Figure A) was obtained.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the answer options.\n\n\u2022 Cecal volvulus (Choice A) \u2013 Typically seen in older patients and those with an abnormally mobile cecum. It has a different classic radiographic appearance and is less common in a young, otherwise healthy individual.\n\n\u2022 Ileus (Choice B) \u2013 Represents a global decrease in bowel motility and is usually associated with recent surgery, electrolyte imbalances, or sepsis. In an otherwise healthy marathon runner, acute paralytic ileus is less likely.\n\n\u2022 Ogilvie syndrome (Choice C) \u2013 This is an acute colonic pseudo\u2010obstruction most commonly seen in elderly, hospitalized, or critically ill patients.\n\n\u2022 Sigmoid volvulus (Choice D) \u2013 In this condition, the sigmoid colon twists on its mesentery. The classic radiograph shows a \u201ccoffee\u2010bean\u201d shape and a large, distended loop of colon. Although sigmoid volvulus is most common in older individuals with chronic constipation, it can occur in young adults who possess a redundant sigmoid colon, and dehydration (such as that which may occur with prolonged exertion) can be a precipitating factor.\n\n\u2022 Small bowel obstruction (Choice E) \u2013 While SBO may present with abdominal distension, pain, and vomiting, in a 24\u2010year\u2010old man without prior surgery (therefore lacking adhesions) or hernias noted on exam, this is less likely than a volvulus.\n\nStep 3: Compare and eliminate. The patient\u2019s radiograph (presumably demonstrating the classic features of a volvulus) along with the clinical picture (including dehydration from running a marathon) makes sigmoid volvulus (Choice D) the most likely diagnosis.\n\nFinal answer: D. Sigmoid volvulus.",
            "Step 1: Look at the key parts of the clinical scenario. The patient is a 24\u2010year\u2010old healthy man who develops abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting while running a marathon. He is tachycardic with a slightly low blood pressure, and his abdomen is both distended and tender. Although his exam has some systemic signs (mild tachycardia) that could be attributed to dehydration from prolonged exercise, the important feature is the abdominal distension combined with tenderness.\n\nStep 2: Consider the differential diagnoses listed. Ileus is generally seen in post-operative settings or with medications and is not usually associated with marked tenderness. Ogilvie syndrome (acute colonic pseudo\u2010obstruction) is typical in older, seriously ill, or hospitalized patients. While volvulus (either cecal or sigmoid) does cause a mechanical obstruction, the typical patient with sigmoid volvulus is an elderly individual with chronic constipation, and cecal volvulus more often occurs in middle\u2010aged patients (with a mobile cecum); both are less common in young, healthy individuals. In contrast, a small bowel obstruction (SBO) can present with abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, and tenderness. On plain radiograph, SBO is characterized by intestinal dilatation, multiple air\u2013fluid levels, and a step\u2010ladder pattern, which would fit with the image described (Figure A).\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the less likely diagnoses. Given his age and clinical history, ileus and Ogilvie syndrome are less likely. Although volvulus represents a form of obstruction, the patient\u2019s age and risk factors (or lack thereof) make a primary volvulus (whether cecal or sigmoid) less likely.\n\nStep 4: Final answer. Considering the distended, tender abdomen, the vomiting, and the radiographic findings in a healthy 24\u2010year\u2010old man, the most likely diagnosis is E. Small bowel obstruction.\n\nFinal answer: E. Small bowel obstruction.",

It can occur in younger adults if there is a congenitally mobile cecum. The clinical picture of acute obstruction (distension, pain, vomiting) after strenuous activity (which may contribute via dehydration or altered gastrointestinal motility) supports this possibility.\n\u2022 Sigmoid Volvulus (Option D): Although volvulus here is more common than cecal volvulus overall, it typically occurs in elderly patients, those with chronic constipation, or institutionalized individuals\u2014not in a young, otherwise healthy runner.\n\u2022 Small Bowel Obstruction (Option E): Most frequently occurs in patients with a history of intra\u2010abdominal surgery (due to adhesions) or hernias. Our patient lacks these risk factors.\n\u2022 Ileus (Option B) and Ogilvie Syndrome (Option C): These are forms of dysfunctional motility rather than an anatomic twisting; ileus is usually postoperative or associated with critical illness, and Ogilvie syndrome (acute colonic pseudo\u2010obstruction) is typically seen in severely ill or hospitalized patients.\n\nStep 3: Narrowing Down the Best Diagnosis\n\u2022 The patient\u2019s age and absence of surgical history, coupled with the acute obstructive picture on exam and radiograph, make a true obstructive process \u2013 most consistent with a volvulus \u2013 more likely than an ileus or pseudo\u2010obstruction.\n\u2022 Between the two types of volvulus offered, sigmoid volvulus is classically seen in older patients.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with lightheadedness and is found to have progressive prolongation of the PR interval on ECG most likely has Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block. Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular node dysfunction.\n\nSecond degree heart block can be divided into Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2 patterns. The Mobitz type 1 pattern is usually a result of dysfunction at the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the Mobitz type 2 pattern is usually caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. In Mobitz type 1 2nd-degree heart block, the PR interval becomes progressively longer with each beat before the dropped QRS complex. In Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block, the PR intervals are consistent in length and the dropped QRS complexes occur at regular intervals. The easiest way to determine whether the PR interval is getting longer is to compare the PR interval just before the dropped beat to the PR interval immediately following the dropped beat. Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block. They discuss how a type 1 2nd-degree heart block is caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. They recommend symptomatic treatment of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG that demonstrates the progressive prolongation of the PR interval (blue lines) until a beat is dropped. This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia. Sinoatrial node dysfunction can be treated with pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped QRS complex and is usually caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node.",

Sinoatrial node",
            "Step 1: Analyze the Clinical Features\n\u2022 The patient is a 68\u2010year\u2010old female with a history of myocardial infarction 6 months ago, now on multiple antiplatelet agents.\n\u2022 She presents with symptoms of lightheadedness and near\u2010syncope. Vital signs are generally stable, with a pulse of 92/min.\n\u2022 Physical exam reveals an irregular heartbeat with normal cardiac sounds.\n\u2022 The current ECG (Figure A) is provided, which, given the description \u201cirregular heartbeat,\u201d likely demonstrates an irregularly irregular rhythm typical of atrial fibrillation.\n\nStep 2: Determine the Likely Arrhythmia and Its Mechanism\n\u2022 An irregularly irregular rhythm is most consistent with atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia wherein the atria have disorganized, chaotic electrical activity.\n\u2022 In normal physiology, the Sinoatrial (SA) node serves as the primary pacemaker, generating a consistent impulse that is propagated throughout the atria.\n\u2022 In atrial fibrillation, the SA node\u2019s organized pacing is overridden by multiple ectopic foci within the atria, leading to the loss of a coordinated atrial contraction.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices\nA. Atrioventricular node \u2013 Although the AV node filters many of the chaotic impulses coming from the atria, it is not the primary site where the abnormal electrical activity originates.\nB. Bundle branches \u2013 These structures conduct electrical impulses to the ventricles; their dysfunction typically results in conduction delays (e.g., bundle branch block) rather than an irregularly irregular rhythm.\nC. Bundle of His \u2013 This is part of the ventricular conduction system; issues here don\u2019t usually produce atrial fibrillation.\nD. Purkinje fibers \u2013 These fine fibers conduct impulses within the ventricles and are not involved in the initiation of atrial fibrillation.\nE. Sinoatrial node \u2013 The SA node is the primary pacemaker whose normal, coordinated electrical impulses are disrupted in atrial fibrillation. Even though the arrhythmia in AF is due to abnormal atrial electrical activity (often from ectopic foci in the atria), the SA node\u2019s role as the dominant pacemaker is essentially \u201coverpowered\u201d by the chaotic impulses.\n\nStep 4: Final Answer\nGiven the patient\u2019s presentation and the nature of atrial fibrillation, the component of the conduction system most impacted by the abnormal electrical activity is the Sinoatrial node.\n\nFinal Answer: E. Sinoatrial node",
            "Step 1: Review the pertinent details of the patient\u2019s presentation.\n\u2022 The patient is a 68\u2010year\u2010old woman with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) 6 months ago.\n\u2022 She presents with dizziness, lightheadedness, and a sensation that she may \u201cpass out,\u201d though she has not experienced syncope.\n\u2022 Her vital signs are stable, and on physical exam she has an irregular heartbeat with normal cardiac sounds.\n\u2022 Her ECG (Figure A, though not shown here) is provided, and given the irregular rhythm, it is suggestive of atrial fibrillation.\n\nStep 2: Consider what the ECG finding implies.\n\u2022 An \u201cirregularly irregular\u201d rhythm without distinct P waves is the classic presentation of atrial fibrillation (AF).\n\u2022 In atrial fibrillation, the normal pacemaking function of the heart is disrupted by chaotic electrical activity, which is typically not emanating from the normally dominant pacemaker, the sinoatrial (SA) node. Instead, multiple ectopic firing sites in the atria take over.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options in relation to the conduction system.\nA. Atrioventricular node \u2013 This structure does not initiate rhythm (it conducts impulses and provides a delay) and isn\u2019t typically the source of an irregular \u201cfibrillatory\u201d rhythm.\nB. Bundle branches \u2013 Damage or block here would often lead to bundle branch block patterns on ECG, not atrial fibrillation.\nC. Bundle of His \u2013 Like the bundle branches, abnormality in the His bundle typically causes conduction delays or blocks rather than a chaotic atrial rhythm.\nD. Purkinje fibers \u2013 These are responsible for rapid conduction in the ventricles; abnormalities here do not typically lead to atrial fibrillation.\nE. Sinoatrial node \u2013 The SA node is the natural pacemaker of the heart. In atrial fibrillation, its regular control over the atria is lost, as disorganized electrical impulses take over. Although the SA node itself may not be intrinsically \u201cabnormal\u201d in classic AF cases, its role as the primary pacemaker is effectively compromised by the erratic atrial activity.\n\nStep 4: Draw your conclusion.\nThe presentation of an irregularly irregular heartbeat and an ECG consistent with atrial fibrillation indicates that the physiologic role of the SA node is being overridden by disorganized electrical activity in the atria. Thus, the component of the conduction system most likely \u201caffected\u201d or rendered non-dominant is the sinoatrial (SA) node.\n\nFinal Answer: E. Sinoatrial node"

The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole. Treatment is by meticulous control of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology such as hypertension.\n\nKino et al studied the relationship between the S1 and S4 heart sounds in aging patients. They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber. Treatment is with diuresis and treatment of the underlying heart failure.\n\nAnswer D: A holosystolic murmur heard at the apex describes mitral valve regurgitation. This would be possible if a papillary muscle had ruptured in an acute myocardial infarction. Treatment is with mitral valve replacement in symptomatic patients.\n\nAnswer E: A normal S1 and S2 is possible but is less likely given this patient's long-standing history of poorly managed hypertension. Hypertension usually causes concentric hypertrophy of the ventricle and thereby leads to increased resistance to diastolic filling.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAn S4 heart sound is created by blood entering a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle and is often heard in patients with long-standing hypertension.",

He is unable to stay focused on any task. His boss often observes him \"daydreaming\" with a blank stare off into space. His boss will have to yell at him to startle him back to work. The patient states that he feels fatigued all the time and sometimes will suddenly fall asleep while operating equipment. He has tried going to bed early for the past month but is unable to fall asleep until 2 hours prior to his alarm. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/68 mmHg, pulse is 81/min, and respirations are 12/min. A physical exam is within normal limits.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with fatigue and an inability to fall asleep until late in the morning suggesting a diagnosis of delayed sleep phase syndrome. The most appropriate initial therapy is light therapy, behavioral therapy, and sleep hygiene practices in addition to decreasing exposure to light at night.\n\nDelayed sleep phase syndrome typically presents with individuals who naturally fall asleep very late and wake up very late. This becomes problematic when they attend school or have a job that requires them to wake up early. The most appropriate initial therapy for delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene practices, and bright light therapy. Bright light therapy involves consistent timed exposure to a light box to simulate natural outdoor light, with the hope of resetting the circadian rhythm and moving the sleep phase earlier. If these measures fail, or if a different diagnosis is suspected, a referral for polysomnography may be indicated.\n\nSletten et al. studied whether melatonin was effective in the treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome. They found that using this medication as an adjunct to sleep hygiene was effective in improving symptoms. They recommend using multimodal therapy for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ethosuximide is the treatment of choice for absence seizures. Though this patient does have episodes of blank staring, this likely does not represent a seizure as he is arousable to return to work by his boss. Patients with absence seizures typically present in childhood and are unable to be aroused during seizure episodes.\n\nAnswer B: Polysomnography or a sleep study would be indicated after sleep hygiene practices have failed. Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if there was a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or an unknown cause of this patient's fatigue. Patients with sleep apnea typically snore and this disease is associated with obesity and increasing age.\n\nAnswer D: Modafinil is a treatment for narcolepsy. Though this patient does have sudden episodes of falling asleep while at work, this is more likely to be related to his sleep schedule. Patients with narcolepsy generally do not feel tired immediately before their episodes of sleep.\n\nAnswer E: Zolpidem is a muscle relaxant and hypnotic with the mechanism of action of a benzodiazepine. Though a drug like zolpidem could be used to help this patient fall asleep, the most appropriate first step is to address the patient's sleep hygiene prior to prescribing a potentially addictive drug.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, and sleep hygiene.",

            "Step 1: Analyze the patient\u2019s symptoms. This 25\u2010year-old man describes difficulty focusing at work, \u201cdaydreaming\u201d with a blank stare, and even falling asleep while operating equipment, which raises concern for a sleep disorder. However, he also reports that for the past month he has been unable to fall asleep until just two hours before his alarm. This late sleep onset suggests a delay in his sleep phase.\n\nStep 2: Consider the possible diagnoses and management options. While modafinil (option C) is used to manage excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, his history of delayed sleep onset points toward a circadian rhythm sleep disorder (specifically, delayed sleep phase syndrome). Moreover, narcolepsy typically includes features like cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or hypnagogic hallucinations, none of which are described here. In delayed sleep phase syndrome, the individual\u2019s internal clock is shifted later relative to conventional societal sleep times.\n\nStep 3: Review the treatment options. For delayed sleep phase syndrome, the best initial management is non-pharmacologic: resetting the circadian rhythm through morning bright light therapy and reducing exposure to light in the evenings (option A). The other options either apply to different conditions (e.g., ethosuximide for absence seizures, zolpidem for insomnia in adults, or polysomnography as a diagnostic tool rather than an initial intervention) or target conditions (like narcolepsy) that do not best fit this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Bright light therapy and decreased light at night",

Importantly, he states that despite trying to go to bed early for the past month, he is unable to fall asleep until about 2 hours before his alarm is set, suggesting a delay in his sleep onset.\n\nStep 2: Consider the differential diagnoses. While excessive daytime sleepiness could be due to conditions such as narcolepsy (which might be treated with modafinil), the patient\u2019s specific difficulty falling asleep early and his delayed sleep onset point toward a circadian rhythm sleep disorder, particularly Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the treatment options.\n\u2022 Option A (Bright light therapy and decreased light at night) is a first-line treatment for DSPS. This involves exposing the patient to bright light in the morning to help reset the circadian clock and reducing evening light exposure, which assists in allowing earlier sleep onset.\n\u2022 Option B (Ethosuximide) is used for treating absence seizures, which are not consistent with this patient\u2019s clinical picture.\n\u2022 Option C (Modafinil) is used in cases of narcolepsy to improve daytime alertness, but it does not address the underlying circadian misalignment.\n\u2022 Option D (Polysomnography) is a diagnostic tool that may be used in sleep studies for various conditions but is not the initial step given the clear description of his symptoms.\n\u2022 Option E (Zolpidem) is a sleeping aid, and while it might temporarily help with sleep onset, it is not considered first-line therapy for a circadian rhythm disorder.\n\nStep 4: Arrive at the final answer.\nGiven the patient\u2019s symptoms and the disruption of his sleep cycle, the most appropriate initial management is Option A: Bright light therapy and a reduction in light exposure at night.\n\nFinal Answer: A.

They typically occur secondary to adhesions which entrap the bowel and disrupt its normal peristalsis. Adhesions can occur after abdominal surgery or trauma as part of the normal healing process. The diagnosis of SBO can be confirmed using abdominal imaging such as a CT scan. Treatment often involves observation; however, surgical decompression of the SBO may be needed if there is a closed-loop obstruction or an obstruction that does not resolve on its own.\n\nRami Reddy and Cappell review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of SBO.

Let\u2019s consider the options:\n\n\u2022 Option A (Bleeding and infected vessel of Kiesselbach plexus) typically causes anterior epistaxis (nosebleeds) but would not explain a worsening unilateral purulent discharge or the patient\u2019s sinusitis history.\n\n\u2022 Option B (Foreign body obstruction) is a common consideration in pediatric patients presenting with unilateral foul-smelling nasal discharge. However, given that this patient was already followed for sinusitis and his symptoms have evolved (worsening pain and blood-tinged discharge) following treatment for sinusitis, this makes a secondary bacterial complication more likely. Moreover, the examination does not mention visualization of a foreign object.\n\n\u2022 Option C (Nasopharyngeal carcinoma) is exceedingly rare in a child and would not fit the acute progression of symptoms seen here.\n\n\u2022 Option D (Septal perforation) usually results from trauma, certain drug exposures (like intranasal cocaine), or chronic inflammatory conditions, and again is less likely in this age group and clinical context.\n\n\u2022 Option E (Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection) best fits the scenario. The child was already diagnosed with acute sinusitis, and his symptoms have worsened despite conservative management. The appearance of unilateral purulent (and blood-tinged) discharge indicates that the initial viral or uncomplicated sinusitis may now have progressed to a bacterial superinfection, which is a known complication.\n\nThus, after evaluating the details, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nFinal answer: E.

        "final_solution": "Step 1: The patient's history and symptoms are key. Although he was initially diagnosed with acute sinusitis, his presentation now includes a unilateral nasal discharge with both purulent material and blood. In children, a unilateral, foul-smelling or bloody nasal discharge should raise suspicion for a nasal foreign body.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each option:\nA. Bleeding and infected vessel of Kiesselbach plexus \u2013 Typically presents with anterior epistaxis (nosebleed) and does not usually produce a purulent discharge.\nB. Foreign body obstruction \u2013 In children, a unilateral, often foul-smelling, purulent (sometimes blood-tinged) nasal discharge is a classic presentation for a nasal foreign body.\nC. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma \u2013 Extremely unlikely in a child and would not present acutely.\nD. Septal perforation \u2013 Generally seen in older individuals or those with a history of trauma or cocaine use; it does not fit this clinical scenario.\nE. Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection \u2013 Although the patient was initially diagnosed with sinusitis, bacterial superinfection typically causes more bilateral symptoms and does not usually result in a unilateral purulent and bloody discharge.\n\nStep 3: Final Answer:\nB. Foreign body obstruction"
