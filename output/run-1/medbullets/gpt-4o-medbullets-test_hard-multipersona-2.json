He states the pain is constant and is primarily located on his right side. When asked to indicate the area of pain, he says that it surrounds his eye and upper forehead. He had one episode of vomiting. The patient also reports difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which he attributes to excessive tearing. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for hypertension. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/91 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient\u2019s right eye is shown in Figure A.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden-onset unilateral vision loss and an orbitofrontal headache with a dilated pupil and a hard ocular globe suggesting a diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Long-term management of angle-closure glaucoma can include acetazolamide.\n\nExamination of the eye in a patient with acute-closure glaucoma will reveal a red eye that is rock-hard and a mid-dilated pupil which is minimally reactive to light. The fundoscopic exam will show an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio (>0.4) and tonometry will show increased intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Acute treatment and long-term management involve the administration of beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide to decrease intraocular pressure. The definitive treatment is iridotomy.\n\nAiraksinen et al. review the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. They discuss how a combination of acetazolamide and beta-blockers can terminate an attack. They recommend using 1 drop of pilocarpine 3 hours after intravenous acetazolamide administration.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing an eye with injected conjunctiva (red circles) and a mid-dilated pupil. These findings are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Amitriptyline can be used as prophylaxis for migraines. Migraines present as unilateral, pulsating headaches that may be associated with nausea or photophobia. Patients with migraines can sometimes experience an aura with visual field changes; however, they would not have exam findings of a rock-hard eye or injection.\n\nAnswer C: Clopidogrel may be used as a conservative treatment for carotid atherosclerosis, which can be an embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO presents as acute, painless, monocular vision loss. A fundoscopic exam will demonstrate ischemia of the retina.\n\nAnswer D: Epinephrine is contraindicated in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma as it increases pupillary dilation. It is used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. This would present with gradually patchy loss of vision and is generally painless.\n\nAnswer E: Verapamil is used as prophylaxis for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches present as unilateral, repetitive, brief headaches associated with severe peri-orbital pain, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPharmacologic management of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",

Acquired immunodeficiency could be considered, but the sudden onset and environmental factor (father's observation) make this less likely.\n\n3. **Intentional Contamination (C):** The father's observation that she does not get sick when he takes care of her raises suspicion of environmental or intentional factors. This could explain recurrent infections and sudden severe symptoms, including shock.\n\n4. **Meningitis (D):** The symptoms of severe headache, stiff neck, fever, and altered mental status are classic for meningitis. However, the recurrent nature of infections and the father's observation suggest another underlying issue.\n\n5. **Urinary tract infection (E):** While she has a history of UTIs, the current presentation is more severe and systemic, indicating something beyond a simple UTI.\n\n**C. Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the recurrent nature of infections, the severe systemic symptoms, and the father's observation, intentional contamination (C) is the most appropriate underlying explanation. This could involve someone deliberately exposing the child to pathogens, leading to recurrent infections and severe systemic illness. Meningitis (D) is a plausible diagnosis for the current symptoms but does not explain the recurrent nature and environmental factor.\n\n**Answer:**\n(C) Intentional contamination",

These symptoms are indicative of a serious systemic infection or neurological involvement.\n2. **History:** She had similar symptoms 6 weeks ago and was treated for an E. coli infection, and a urinary tract infection 10 weeks ago. This suggests recurrent infections.\n3. **Vital Signs:** The patient is hypotensive (blood pressure 60/35 mmHg), tachycardic (pulse 190/min), tachypneic (respirations 33/min), and has a mild fever (99.5\u00b0F). These signs are consistent with shock, possibly septic shock.\n4. **Treatment:** She is started on intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a severe infection or sepsis.\n\n**B. Option Analysis:**\n1. **Gastroenteritis (A):** Typically presents with vomiting and diarrhea, but does not explain the stiff neck, severe headache, or altered mental status. It is unlikely to cause such severe systemic symptoms and hypotension.\n   \n2. **Immunodeficiency (B):** Could explain recurrent infections, but does not directly account for the acute presentation of stiff neck and severe headache. Immunodeficiency would predispose her to infections but does not directly cause the symptoms described.\n\n3. **Intentional contamination (C):** This option suggests possible Munchausen syndrome by proxy or similar scenarios. The fact that the father notes she does not get sick when he takes care of her could hint at this. However, it does not directly explain the acute presentation of stiff neck and severe headache.\n\n4. **Meningitis (D):** The symptoms of severe headache, stiff neck, fever, altered mental status, and vomiting are classic signs of meningitis. Meningitis can cause septic shock, explaining the hypotension and tachycardia. This is the most fitting explanation for the acute presentation.\n\n5. **Urinary tract infection (E):** While she has a history of UTIs, the acute presentation of stiff neck, severe headache, and altered mental status is not typical for a UTI. UTIs can cause fever and vomiting but are unlikely to cause neurological symptoms like a stiff neck and severe headache.\n\n**C. Conclusion:**\nThe symptoms of severe headache, stiff neck, altered mental status, and vomiting are classic for meningitis.

He was outside tending to his lawn for several hours in the heat, when he stood up suddenly from pulling weeds and fainted. He denies any preceding symptoms and returned to baseline within 1 minute. The patient is not aware of any medical problems and just started seeing a primary care physician last week. He recently used a friend's prescription for ondansetron for nausea. His temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg, pulse is 107/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals intact cranial nerves, normal strength and sensation, and a stable gait. His abdomen is soft and nontender. An ECG is performed as seen in Figure A. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis based on this patient\u2019s ECG?",
        "answer": "Previous myocardial ischemia",
        "options": {

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after syncope, likely secondary to dehydration and orthostatic hypotension given his outdoor gardening in the heat and symptoms when standing up rapidly. The patient\u2019s ECG reveals deep, pathologic Q waves, which in this case are an incidental finding indicative of a previous myocardial infarction or a previous ischemic event.\n\nThe Q wave is a negative deflection just prior to the R wave. Q waves are a normal finding when they are small and are seen on most ECGs. However, pathologic Q waves are indicative of myocardial ischemia. Pathologic Q waves are generally diagnosed when they are >2 mm deep, >1 mm wide, >25% of the QRS complex height, or are seen in leads V1-V3. The interpretation of Q waves depends on other findings on ECG and the patient's symptoms. Deep Q waves in the setting of ST elevation indicate an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, pathologic Q waves found incidentally indicate a previous myocardial infarction or previous ischemic event.\n\nRovai et al. review Q waves. They discuss how Q waves can be used to predict the location and size of a myocardial infarction as correlated with MRI. They recommend testing such as cardiac MRI to assess for previous infarction in the appropriate patient population.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating pathologic Q waves (red arrows). Note the deep and wide Q waves; this raises concern for a past ischemic event.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute myocardial infarctions would present with ST elevation in a vascular distribution on ECG with possible reciprocal depressions. While T wave inversions may be indicative of new or acute ischemia, deep pathologic Q waves without ST elevation are indicative of previous infarction.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia would cause U waves on ECG, which appear as a small, \"second T wave\" after the initial T wave. Note they are not U-shaped despite their name. Management is centered on repletion of potassium and often magnesium as well.\n\nAnswer C: Intermittent torsades de pointes can cause syncope and should be suspected in a patient with syncope in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. This patient\u2019s QT interval is not particularly prolonged, and his syncope seems to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Management is centered on cessation of QT-prolonging medications and magnesium administration. Note that while ondansetron does prolong the QT interval, it is unlikely to cause torsades given the patient took it a week ago.\n\nAnswer E: Pulmonary emboli would present on ECG with sinus tachycardia in addition to pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia. Note that the ECG is a nonspecific test for pulmonary emboli, and CT angiography is the preferred confirmatory test for this condition. Syncope is a possible presentation of larger pulmonary emboli (though the patient would also be hemodynamically unstable).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPathologic Q waves are indicative of a previous myocardial infarction.",

        "reason": "This patient presents following a motor vehicle accident with a tender abdomen and stable vital signs. Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding. This stable patient with a benign exam can undergo a CT scan, which will offer more data than a FAST exam and would be performed regardless of whether a FAST exam was positive or negative given this patient's intoxication and abdominal bruising.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn a patient who has experienced blunt abdominal trauma the most appropriate initial step in a stable patient is an abdominal CT scan.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with persistent acne vulgaris that is refractory to topical benzoyl peroxide and retinoids. The next step in management is topical antibiotics.\n\nAcne vulgaris is caused by blockage or outlet obstruction of the pilosebaceous unit. It presents with erythema, pustules, and comedones typically in young men going through puberty. Risk factors include stress, excessive sweating, greasy skin care products, and steroid use. The management of acne vulgaris, in order, is to start with topical benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids, topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, and isoretinoin. It is important to try a therapy for a proper duration before switching to a more invasive therapy.\n\nEichenfield et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of patients with acne vulgaris. They discuss how this disease can be treated with benzoyl peroxide. They recommend using antibiotics or isotretinoin for refractory cases.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating diffuse comedones over the forehead (red circle). These findings are classically seen in patients with acne vulgaris.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Continuing current therapy for 1 more month is unnecessary as this patient's symptoms have not improved at all with 1 month of therapy. Continuing current therapy would be appropriate if the patient had only tried therapy for a few days.\n\nAnswer B: Dietary interventions have not been shown to improve outcomes in acne vulgaris. Stopping illicit substances such as performance enhancing steroids can be effective in reducing acne symptoms but there is no evidence this patient has been using steroids.\n\nAnswer C: Isoretinoin is the last-line therapy for acne vulgaris. It should not be given to pregnant women as it is teratogenic. Women taking isoretinoin should be on reliable birth control. Topical and oral antibiotics should be used first.\n\nAnswer D: Oral antibiotics would be indicated after topical antibiotics fail. Topical antibiotics should be tried first as these do not have systemic side effects.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe management of acne vulgaris is to start with topical benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids, followed by topical antibiotics, oral antibiotics, and isoretinoin in increasing order of severity.",

It most commonly occurs weeks to months after the MI, but can also occur within 1 week from an MI in rare cases. It is believed to result from an autoimmune reaction that occurs after damage to the heart (surgery and MI). It presents with chest pain, fever, pleuritic pain, and a pericardial friction rub.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral cataracts most likely has classic galactosemia. Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk. Patients will also develop bilateral cataracts if the deficit is not detected in the first few weeks after birth. Avoiding galactose by changing to a soy-based formula will avoid the complications of this disorder.\n\nTurck discusses using soy protein for infant feeding. The author notes that there are safety concerns with regards to the high phyto-estrogenic isoflavone content of these formulas. The author recommends that despite these safety concerns, these formulas should still be used in patients with classic galactosemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods would be effective in the treatment of hereditary fructose intolerance. This disease presents similarly to classic galactosemia, but cataracts would not be seen in patients with this disease.\n\nAnswer C: Providing imiglucerase enzyme replacement would be effective in the treatment of patients with Gaucher disease, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, associated findings in this disease would be anemia and avascular necrosis of the bones.\n\nAnswer D: Removing phenylalanine from the maternal diet during pregnancy would be effective in the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, these patients classically present with a \"musty smell\" and eczema.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 supplementation may be effective in mitigating the negative symptoms of homocystinuria. This disease may also present with cataracts or lens dislocations. Associated findings in this disorder would be marfanoid appearance and arachnodactyly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with classic galactosemia should not be breastfed and should receive a galactose-free and lactose-free diet such as soy-based formulas.",

Therefore, the intervention that could have avoided the patient's symptoms is to change to a soy-based formula, which does not contain lactose and thus prevents the intake of galactose.\n\nLet's review the options:\n\n(A) Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods: This option is not directly relevant to galactosemia, as the primary concern is lactose, not fructose or other sugars found in fruit juices.\n\n(B) Changing to a soy-based formula: This option directly addresses the need to eliminate lactose from the diet, thereby preventing the symptoms associated with galactosemia.\n\n(C) Providing imiglucerase enzyme replacement: This is used for Gaucher's disease, not galactosemia, and is irrelevant to the current condition.\n\n(D) Removing phenylalanine from maternal diet during pregnancy: This pertains to phenylketonuria (PKU), not galactosemia, and is not applicable here.\n\n(E) Vitamin B6 supplementation: This is not related to the management of galactosemia.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate intervention to prevent the symptoms of galactosemia in this patient is option B, changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nFinal answer: B",
        "final_thinking": "The passage discusses the clinical presentation and management of galactosemia, indicating that the primary concern is the metabolism of galactose from lactose. It highlights that switching to a soy-based formula eliminates lactose from the diet, which directly addresses the issue. The other options either do not relate to galactosemia or are relevant to different conditions. Therefore, the option that effectively prevents the symptoms is option B."

        "question": "A 25-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her family. They found her somnolent next to her computer with an empty pill bottle around 3 hours ago. The family cannot recall the types of pill bottles that they found and did not bring them to the ED. The patient's medical history is notable for anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She is currently not on any medications. She was given an exercise program but she has not been compliant with these exercises. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 82/min, blood pressure is 125/85 mmHg, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Physical exam is within normal limits. The patient begins communicating with the physician and states that she did take acetaminophen but it was only a few pills. Her parents are certain the bottle was new. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with acute acetaminophen intoxication. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance. This is no longer a preferred method of managing toxicities as patients can aspirate the vomitus or the toxic substance can induce more tissue damage during vomiting. In general, syrup of ipecac is the wrong answer choice for all toxicity cases.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAcetaminophen toxicity should be treated immediately with N-acetyl cysteine followed by further diagnostic workup including serum acetaminophen levels.",

Asthma is characterized by reversible airway obstruction due to bronchial hyperreactivity and inflammation, leading to symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and decreased airflow.\n\nIn asthma, pulmonary function tests typically show a decreased FEV1 and a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio due to the obstructive nature of the disease.

The normal DLCO indicates that the alveolar-capillary interface is intact, which is consistent with asthma pathology.\n\nThe insights from the Innovative Medical Thinker, Critical Medical Analyst, and Clinical Decision Specialist all converge on the understanding that normal DLCO is a characteristic finding in asthma, as it reflects the absence of significant damage to the alveolar-capillary interface.

        "reason": "This patient's non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, alkaline urine, and history of a calcium phosphate kidney stone and rheumatoid arthritis are suggestive of type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis. The treatment of choice is alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate).\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis results from impaired acid (H+) secretion in the distal nephron. Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis. They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case. The patient's muscle weakness is more suggestive of hypokalemia secondary to type 1 renal tubular acidosis. She does not report symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (joint pain/stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with use).\n\nBullet Summary:\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis is treated with alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate).",

The patient has a medical history of alcoholism and has been admitted to the hospital multiple times for withdrawal, abdominal pain, and traumatic injuries from his drinking. The patient states that his last drink was more than 1 year ago. His temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/78 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a non-tender, non-distended abdomen. Laboratory studies are notable for a serum calcium of 7.0 mg/dL. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen is performed as seen in Figure A. A Sudan Black stain of the patient\u2019s stool is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea?",

            "A": "Ciprofloxacin",
            "B": "Loperamide",

        "answer_idx": "D",
        "reason": "This patient with a history of alcoholism is presenting with steatorrhea (foul-smelling diarrhea that stains with Sudan Black, a stain that detects fat in the stool), hypocalcemia, and findings suggestive of chronic pancreatitis on CT scan (inflammatory changes and calcification). His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy. The authors recommend the use of endoscopic ultrasound in securing the diagnosis in patients with equivocal imaging findings and a high index of suspicion, such as patients with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating calcifications and chronic inflammatory injury (red arrows) suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone is the appropriate management of infectious diarrhea from a bacterial organism. This usually presents with fever, as well as bloody or purulent diarrhea. In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected. This patient\u2019s diarrhea is likely caused by his chronic pancreatitis; thus, oral rehydration may be indicated but does not address the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Rifaximin is an antibiotic that targets gut flora and can decrease enteric flora and treat conditions such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth presents in patients with conditions such as diabetic gastroparesis or scleroderma secondary to decreased bowel motility causing bacterial overgrowth and profuse diarrhea. Treating the underlying cause in addition to rifaximin will eliminate the excess bacteria.\n\nBullet Summary:\nProton pump inhibitors should be given in patients with persistent diarrhea in the setting of chronic pancreatitis to prevent the inactivation of pancreatic enzymes.",

The patient's history of steroid use and smoking could contribute to nerve damage or compression.\n\n**Answer:**\n(B) Brachial plexopathy",
                "To analyze this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms, medical history, and the options provided. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n### A. Patient Presentation and History\n1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with weakness in the right arm, decreased sensation, and dull aching and burning pain. The weakness has been present for a few weeks, and today it was severe enough to cause him to drop a cup. \n2. **Medical History**: The patient has diabetes, consumes alcohol regularly, smokes heavily, and uses anabolic steroids. He has also experienced significant weight loss (17 pounds in a month).\n3. **Vital Signs**: The patient has a mild fever, high blood pressure, normal pulse, normal respirations, and normal oxygen saturation.\n4. **Physical Exam**: There is decreased sensation and significant weakness (2/5 strength) in the right arm, while the left arm is normal (5/5 strength).\n\n### B. Analysis of Options\n1. **Apical Lung Tumor (Pancoast Tumor)**: This could cause arm weakness and pain due to compression of the brachial plexus or sympathetic chain, leading to Horner's syndrome. However, Horner's syndrome is not mentioned, and the symptoms are not positional.\n   \n2. **Brachial Plexopathy**: This involves damage to the brachial plexus, which could cause weakness, sensory changes, and pain in the arm. The symptoms fit well with this diagnosis, especially given the steroid use and weight loss, which could suggest a neoplastic process affecting the plexus.\n\n3. **Cerebral Infarction**: This would typically cause more widespread neurological deficits, possibly including facial involvement, and would not usually present with isolated arm symptoms over weeks. The acute nature of dropping the cup could suggest a stroke, but the chronicity of symptoms and lack of other neurological signs make this less likely.\n\n4. **Scalenus Anticus Syndrome**: This is a type of thoracic outlet syndrome where the subclavian artery and brachial plexus are compressed by the anterior scalene muscle. Symptoms can include arm pain and weakness, but they are often positional, which is not the case here.\n\n5. **Subclavian Steal Syndrome**: This involves retrograde blood flow in the vertebral artery due to subclavian artery stenosis, leading to arm claudication and neurological symptoms. However, it typically presents with dizziness or syncope, which are not mentioned here.\n\n### C. Conclusion\nThe symptoms of right arm weakness, sensory changes, and pain, along with the patient's history of steroid use and significant weight loss, are most consistent with a brachial plexopathy. This could be due to a neoplastic process, possibly related to the steroid use or another underlying condition.\n\n### Answer\n(B) Brachial plexopathy",

Symptoms have been present for a few weeks, with acute worsening.\n- **Physical Exam**: 2/5 strength in the right arm, 5/5 strength in the left arm, decreased sensation in the right arm.\n- **Vital Signs**: Elevated blood pressure (177/108 mmHg), slight fever (99.5\u00b0F), normal pulse, respirations, and oxygen saturation.\n- **Other Factors**: Recent weight loss (17 pounds in one month), use of anabolic steroids.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n\n#### (A) Apical lung tumor\n- **Consideration**: An apical lung tumor, such as a Pancoast tumor, can cause symptoms due to compression of the brachial plexus or sympathetic chain, leading to arm weakness, pain, and sensory changes.\n- **Relevance**: The patient's smoking history and weight loss could suggest a malignancy. The symptoms of arm weakness and pain align with possible brachial plexus involvement.\n\n#### (B) Brachial plexopathy\n- **Consideration**: Brachial plexopathy involves damage to the brachial plexus, causing weakness, sensory loss, and pain in the arm.\n- **Relevance**: The symptoms match, but the cause is not specified. It could be secondary to a tumor or other compressive lesion.\n\n#### (C) Cerebral infarction\n- **Consideration**: A cerebral infarction (stroke) could cause unilateral weakness and sensory changes.\n- **Relevance**: The acute worsening of symptoms could suggest a stroke, but the presence of pain and the chronicity of symptoms are less typical for a stroke.\n\n#### (D) Scalenus anticus syndrome\n- **Consideration**: This is a form of thoracic outlet syndrome where the subclavian artery or brachial plexus is compressed by the scalenus anterior muscle.\n- **Relevance**: Symptoms can include arm pain and weakness, but the chronicity and weight loss are less typical.\n\n#### (E) Subclavian steal syndrome\n- **Consideration**: This syndrome involves retrograde blood flow in the vertebral artery due to subclavian artery stenosis, leading to arm claudication and neurological symptoms.\n- **Relevance**: The symptoms are not consistent with subclavian steal syndrome, which typically involves dizziness or syncope with arm use.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of chronic symptoms, right arm weakness, sensory changes, pain, significant weight loss, and the patient's smoking history strongly suggests a compressive lesion, such as an apical lung tumor (Pancoast tumor), affecting the brachial plexus.

Pancoast tumors can cause shoulder and arm pain, weakness, and sensory changes due to compression of the brachial plexus.\n   - **Brachial Plexopathy:** This is a broad term that could describe the symptoms, but it does not specify the underlying cause. In this context, it could be secondary to a Pancoast tumor.\n   - **Cerebral Infarction:** Typically presents with more acute onset and often involves other neurological deficits. The gradual onset and specific arm involvement make this less likely.\n   - **Scalenus Anticus Syndrome:** Involves compression of the brachial plexus and subclavian artery, but symptoms often change with neck position, which is not the case here.\n   - **Subclavian Steal Syndrome:** Involves vascular symptoms due to blood flow reversal, typically presenting with dizziness or syncope, which are not present here.\n\n### Updated Answer:\n\n(A) **Apical lung tumor (Pancoast tumor)**\n\nThe patient's symptoms, significant smoking history, and recent weight loss strongly suggest a Pancoast tumor. The involvement of the brachial plexus causing right arm weakness, sensory changes, and pain aligns with this diagnosis. The gradual onset and lack of positional change in symptoms further support this conclusion over other options.",

Pancoast tumors can cause brachial plexopathy due to their location at the lung apex.\n   - **Brachial Plexopathy:** While the symptoms align with brachial plexopathy, the underlying cause needs to be identified. A Pancoast tumor could be the cause of the plexopathy.\n   - **Cerebral Infarction:** Unlikely due to the localized nature of symptoms and absence of other neurological deficits.\n   - **Scalenus Anticus Syndrome:** Typically involves positional changes affecting symptoms, which is not the case here.\n   - **Subclavian Steal Syndrome:** Would present with vascular symptoms and is less likely given the symptom profile.\n\n**Updated Answer:**\n\n(A) Apical lung tumor\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe patient's smoking history, significant weight loss, and symptoms of right arm weakness, decreased sensation, and pain are highly suggestive of a Pancoast tumor. This type of tumor, located at the apex of the lung, can invade the brachial plexus, leading to brachial plexopathy.

It typically occurs in a patient with a history of sinusitis, oral contraceptive pill usage, smoking, or other risk factors that could cause a hypercoagulable state. These patients will often present with severe pain, a sudden headache, and diplopia. A distinct appearance is typically noted with periorbital edema. These patients should be immediately treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and undergo surgical drainage of the inciting source of infection. In some cases, thrombolytics can be used as well.\n\nCaranfa and Yoon review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of septic cavernous sinus thrombosis. They discuss how this diagnosis was almost universally fatal in the pre-antibiotic era. They recommend using broad-spectrum antibiotics and debridement to address this disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating a face with swelling and periorbital edema (red circles). This appearance is classically seen in patients with CST.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid would be appropriate management of acute otitis media or sinusitis; however, it is insufficient coverage for CST. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical intervention are needed to prevent loss of vision.\n\nAnswer B: A CT scan of the head could be indicated potentially for surgical planning in a more stable patient; however, in this situation, immediate intervention is more dire.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with bright red blood per rectum with a non-tender abdomen. Of the answer choices given, angiodysplasia is the most likely to cause such profuse and sudden bleeding.\n\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly in the colon. The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding. Any patient who is unstable or anemic with a hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL requires a transfusion with blood products. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of bright red blood per rectum but is not more common than diverticulosis.\n\nGarcia-Compeon et al. review the presentation and treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. The authors note that angiodysplasias are the cause of many \"occult\" GI bleeds not visualized on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. The authors recommend the use of capsule endoscopy in occult GI bleeds to identify angiodysplasias as a potential source.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Erosion into a gastric vessel is the pathophysiology of a bleeding gastric vessel secondary to peptic ulcer disease. This usually presents with melena (black tarry stools) rather than bright red blood per rectum. Only in cases of extremely brisk upper GI bleeding would patients present with bright red blood per rectum. Treatment involves treating Helicobacter pylori infection if present, proton pump inhibitors, and sucralfate. Endoscopy is needed to confirm and treat the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching is the pathophysiology of diverticulitis which presents with a history of constipation with a fever and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Management involves a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and administration of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or ceftriaxone and metronidazole). Diverticulosis presents with bright red blood and is possible in this patient, but it does not involve inflammation or infection, which defines diverticulitis.\n\nAnswer C: Malignancy or colon cancer can present with bright red blood per rectum, malaise, weight loss, and microcytic anemia. While it is possible in this patient, his age, lack of risk factors for colon cancer, and the sudden onset of his symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.\n\nAnswer D: Submucosal esophageal (Mallory-Weiss) tear presents after profuse vomiting (as in this patient) with bloody vomitus. Treatment is supportive and involves antiemetics.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation that presents with bright red blood per rectum.",

The patient's history of vomiting could suggest a gastric issue, but the presentation of bright red blood is less consistent with this option.\n\n(B) **Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching (Diverticulitis)**: This condition can cause lower gastrointestinal bleeding, but it is often associated with abdominal pain and fever. The patient has a nontender abdomen and only a slight fever, making this less likely.\n\n(C) **Malignancy**: Colorectal cancer can cause bleeding, but it is usually a more chronic process and often presents with additional symptoms such as weight loss or changes in bowel habits. The acute nature of this patient's symptoms and his otherwise healthy status make malignancy less likely.\n\n(D) **Submucosal esophageal tear (Mallory-Weiss tear)**: This is a tear in the mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction, often caused by forceful vomiting. It can lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which may present as bright red blood if the bleeding is brisk. The patient's history of excessive alcohol intake and profuse vomiting aligns well with this condition.\n\n(E) **Vascular malformation**: Conditions like arteriovenous malformations can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but they are less common and typically present with chronic or recurrent bleeding episodes rather than acute onset following vomiting.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe patient's history of excessive alcohol consumption and profuse vomiting, combined with the presentation of bright red blood in the stool, strongly suggests a Mallory-Weiss tear.

        "reason": "This young girl with a recent history of a cat bite and difficulty walking most likely has likely Pasteurella multocida osteomyelitis. Empiric IV antibiotic therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam is the most appropriate initial management.\n\nPasteurella multocida is a gram-negative rod that is associated with cat and dog bites. Infection can lead to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Treatment of minor infection is with amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, patients suspected of having osteomyelitis should be treated empirically with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and sulbactam) and taken for biopsy/culture to identify the pathogen. Antibiotics can then be narrowed down accordingly. Patients will often require between 4-8 weeks of antibiotic treatment. MRSA coverage may initially be started and tapered later once cultures result.\n\nMollitt reviews the evidence regarding the microbiology of various injuries. He discusses how Pasteurella multocida is a common complication of animal bites. He recommends early effective antibiotic treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answer:\nAnswer A: Amoxicillin and clavulanate can be used to treat Pasteurella infection. Patients with osteomyelitis should not be treated with oral antibiotics initially, in particular, when there are systemic manifestations as is present in this patient. IV antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam are the mainstay for empiric osteomyelitis treatment after an animal bite in a patient with systemic manifestations.\n\nAnswer C: Doxycycline is used to treat uncomplicated chlamydia infections. Gonococcal osteomyelitis may present in sexually active individuals and may be associated with septic arthritis. Sexually active patients may be suspected of having this disease.\n\nAnswer D: Fluconazole is an antifungal that is used to treat Candida osteomyelitis. Candida osteomyelitis would be highly unusual in patients with no other risk factors. Instead, this disease is more common in immunodeficient patients or those who use IV drugs.\n\nAnswer E: Vancomycin is used for MRSA infections. Although S. aureus is the most common overall cause of osteomyelitis, this patient with a recent animal bite most likely has Pasteurella infection and this organism should be covered accordingly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with suspicion of Pasteurella osteomyelitis infection after an animal bite should be treated with empiric IV antibiotics such as ampicillin and sulbactam.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with symptoms of heart failure (CHF). The most likely laboratory abnormalities are elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), low sodium, and low potassium.\n\nHeart failure is characterized by the decreased performance of the cardiac ventricles resulting in ventricular dilation. As the ventricles dilate, they release BNP as a marker of stretching of myocardial tissue. BNP levels can therefore serve as a marker of CHF. The kidneys will also have decreased perfusion levels in this disease leading to several key physiologic changes. First, is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which serves to increase perfusion to the kidneys by increasing blood pressure. This system achieves increased blood pressure by maintaining sodium and fluid retention at the expense of decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and decreased hydronium ions (metabolic alkalosis). In addition, ADH is also increased to further increase perfusion, resulting in water retention, hemodilution, and hyponatremia.\n\nMa et al. studied the correlation between BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes. They found that patients with CHF and high levels of BNP had increased rates of cardiovascular complications. They recommend assessing BNP levels in patients who are suspected of having CHF.\n\nFigure A is a chart with changes in brain natriuretic peptide, anti-diuretic hormone, sodium, and potassium that would be seen in various diseases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, and high potassium does not reflect the changes that would be seen in CHF. Though aldosterone serves to retain sodium, it also absorbs water. Thus, hypernatremia would not be seen. This pattern could be seen in patients with heart failure who have high free water losses such as after a burn or in desert environments.\n\nAnswer B: High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the appropriate increase in ADH and subsequent decrease in sodium that would be seen in CHF. Patients who have diabetes insipidus can have low ADH in this setting resulting in loss of free water.\n\nAnswer D: Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the finding of elevated BNP that is classically found in the dilated ventricles of CHF. This pattern would be seen in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH where excessive resorption of free water results in hemodilution.\n\nAnswer E: Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and normal potassium reflect the findings in a healthy patient. This patient most likely has CHF, which would result in increased aldosterone and ADH function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCommon lab findings in heart failure include elevated BNP, elevated ADH, low sodium, and low potassium.",

        "reason": "This patient presents with Marfanoid habitus, joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, developmental delay, and downward lens subluxation, which suggests a diagnosis of homocystinuria. Homocystinuria predisposes to thromboembolic events such as stroke.\n\nAlthough homocystinuria shares many features with Marfan syndrome, patients with homocystinuria also present with a fair complexion, intellectual disability, and downward subluxation of the lens (instead of the upward subluxation seen in Marfan syndrome). Patients with homocystinuria are also at an increased risk of thromboembolic events that disproportionally affect the cerebral vessels. Similar to Marfan syndrome, patients have phenotypic features of a Marfanoid habitus, including tall stature, long limbs, arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, pectus deformity, and scoliosis. Treatment includes vitamin B6 supplementation.\n\nHasan et al. review the evidence regarding diseases associated with homocystinuria. They discuss how this disease is associated with cancer and Alzheimer disease. They recommend screening for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aortic dissection is a complication of Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene. It is also associated with elevated homocysteine levels. Although Marfan syndrome shares many features with homocystinuria, the fair complexion, and intellectual disability seen in this patient are specific to homocystinuria. Treatment involves avoidance of contact sports and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer B: Medullary thyroid cancer is part of the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B), which is caused by a mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. Patients with MEN2B present with Marfanoid habitus, but they do not present with the other features described in this vignette, including fair complexion, intellectual disability, and downward lens subluxation. Treatment is with surgical excision of tumors.\n\nAnswer C: Osteoarthritis is a complication of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Although patients with EDS may present with many of the phenotypic features of both Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria, patients are much less likely to have lens subluxation. Osteoarthritis may be seen with higher incidence in patients with homocystinuria. Treatment is with brace support of unstable joints.\n\nAnswer E: Wilms tumor is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a pediatric overgrowth disorder usually caused by a mutation at chromosome 11p15. BWS presents with macrosomia (\u201cgigantism\u201d), which is defined as height and weight > 97th percentile. BWS additionally presents with omphalocele, hemihyperplasia, visceromegaly, neonatal hypoglycemia, and other embryonal tumors, including hepatoblastoma and neuroblastoma.

        "reason": "This patient who uses intravenous drugs with skin abscesses (the likely source of his infection) is hypotensive and tachycardic, with a blood pressure that is not responding to IV fluids; this is concerning for septic shock. Given his persistent hypotension, he should be started on vasopressors of which norepinephrine is first line and epinephrine is second line.\n\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening, systemic bacterial infection that leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Early management is centered on IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and workup to uncover the source. If the patient's blood pressure does not respond to IV fluids (by definition, their blood pressure will not respond to fluids in septic shock), vasopressors should be started with a goal mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. The first line vasopressor is norepinephrine, which can be titrated up for maximal effect. If this vasopressor fails to reach blood pressure goals, then the next vasopressor is either vasopressin or epinephrine (either is acceptable). If the second line vasopressor fails to increase blood pressure, then the third line vasopressor is vasopressin or epinephrine (whichever was not used as the second line pressor). Finally, the fourth line vasopressor for septic shock is phenylephrine.\n\nLevy et al. review sepsis. They update the Surviving Sepsis campaign which gives the most up to date management guidelines of sepsis including adequate fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors. They recommend early antibiotics and resuscitation to minimize morbidity and mortality.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating sinus tachycardia. Note the presence of P waves (red arrows highlighting several examples) that are present throughout all leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardioversion would be appropriate in an unstable patient with unstable vital signs in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to convert the patient to normal sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation would present with an irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves. Cardioversion would not be indicated in sinus tachycardia.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone is a potent glucocorticoid that also has mineralocorticoid properties. While giving an IV steroid may have a permissive effect on blood pressure (via upregulating alpha-1 receptors on the vasculature) there is no reason that this patient would have a low cortisol level (such as in chronic steroid use). Epinephrine is a better answer in this case, though steroids can be considered. Steroids are typically reserved for patients failing at least 2 vasopressors (unless they have a known cortisol-deficient state).\n\nAnswer D: Normal saline is unlikely to benefit this patient as he has already been sufficiently fluid resuscitated. Moreover, it seems the patient may be developing pulmonary edema (hypoxia, jugular venous distension), a sign of fluid overload.\n\nAnswer E: Phenylephrine is the fourth line vasopressor and is an alpha-1 agonist. It is much less potent than norepinephrine and epinephrine, and would not be started in the management of septic shock until the patient has received epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn septic shock, the vasopressors given (in order) are norepinephrine, epinephrine/vasopressin, then phenylephrine.",

        "reason": "This patient with a history of possible anabolic steroid use (wrestler with acne) who presents with right upper quadrant pain and an enhancing lesion in the liver most likely has a hepatic adenoma. The treatment of hepatic adenomas is surgical removal and discontinuation of precipitating agents.\n\nHepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors that typically arise in the right hepatic lobe. They are typically solitary masses but multiple lesions can be seen in patients with prolonged contraceptive or anabolic steroid use and those who have glycogen storage disorders. Patients present with abdominal pain that is localized in the epigastrium or in the right upper quadrant. Sudden, severe abdominal pain with hypotension suggests rupture of the hepatic adenoma into the peritoneum. The lesions can be confirmed on imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. For hepatic adenomas that are < 5 cm and asymptomatic, simply discontinuing the causative drug and observing are acceptable. Large or symptomatic lesions requiring surgical resection in addition to discontinuation of the offending agent. Because these tumors are highly vascular, failure to resect may result in rupture, hemoperitoneum, and shock. Biopsy is contraindicated to avoid rupturing the mass and causing hemorrhage.\n\nKlompenhouwer et al. studied the current management strategies in patients with hepatocellular adenoma. They found that various molecular groups have been identified allowing for subtyping of these lesions. They recommend performing a CT scan to better characterize these lesions.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT with an enhancing mass with a hypoattenuating fatty component. This is characteristically seen in large hepatic adenomas, which are solitary well-marginated lesions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole would be an effective treatment if this patient had contracted Entamoeba histolytica from contaminated food or water on his recent trip to Mexico. While this amoeba can lead to a liver abscess presenting as a mass on CT, it often also causes abdominal pain and dysentery due to intestinal involvement.\n\nAnswer B: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used for hepatitis C. This patient does have risk factors for hepatitis C (risky sexual behavior and intravenous drug use). Although hepatitis C could lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cause a liver mass, this patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Even if he did have hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatitis C alone without surgical resection or adjuvant therapies would be insufficient.\n\nAnswer C: Follow-up CT in 3 months would be dangerous for this man with a large hepatic adenoma. In the interim, the mass will likely continue to grow if he continues to use anabolic steroids, increasing the risk of rupture. Observation and repeat imaging may be suitable for asymptomatic hepatic lesions that are of uncertain but likely benign etiology.\n\nAnswer D: Biopsying the liver mass is appropriate if malignancy is suspected and there is no concern for hepatic adenoma. If an adenoma is on the differential, biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of rupture and hemorrhage intraoperatively.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHepatic adenomas are benign, vascular liver masses associated with oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids that should be promptly resected if large and symptomatic.",

This is confirmed by the CT scan.\n   - He has a history of unprotected sex with multiple partners and intravenous drug use during a recent vacation to Mexico, which raises concerns for infectious diseases, particularly those affecting the liver.\n   - He has vague, mild discomfort in the right upper quadrant since the start of the wrestling season, which could be related to the liver mass found on the CT scan.\n   - The CT scan reveals a large liver mass measuring 6 cm.\n\nB. **Clinical Considerations:**\n   - The liver mass is an incidental finding during the evaluation for appendicitis. Given the patient's history of intravenous drug use and unprotected sex, there is a risk for infectious causes such as hepatitis, which can lead to liver masses.\n   - The size of the liver mass (6 cm) is significant and warrants further investigation to determine its nature (benign vs. malignant vs. infectious).\n   - Immediate management of appendicitis is necessary, but the liver mass requires a separate approach.\n\nC. **Options Analysis:**\n   - **(A) Administer metronidazole:** Metronidazole is an antibiotic effective against anaerobic bacteria and certain parasites. It is not typically used for liver masses unless there is a suspicion of an abscess caused by an organism like Entamoeba histolytica. However, without further evidence of an abscess, this option is not the most appropriate next step.\n   - **(B) Administer sofosbuvir:** Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used to treat hepatitis C. While the patient's history raises the possibility of hepatitis, the presence of a liver mass requires further characterization before initiating treatment for hepatitis C.\n   - **(C) Obtain follow-up CT of the abdomen in 3 months:** This option suggests monitoring the liver mass over time. However, given the size of the mass (6 cm), immediate further investigation is warranted rather than waiting.\n   - **(D) Perform liver mass biopsy:** A biopsy would provide histological information about the liver mass, helping to determine its nature (benign, malignant, infectious).

        "reason": "This postpartum patient is presenting with hypertension, headache, blurry vision, and abdominal pain, which are concerning for a diagnosis of preeclampsia. The most appropriate initial intervention is magnesium.\n\nPreeclampsia classically presents after 20 weeks gestation (or earlier in the setting of a molar pregnancy) with hypertension and proteinuria. Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed. The most important initial step in management is to administer magnesium which is neuroprotective and also modestly lowers blood pressure. Further care involves blood pressure control and benzodiazepines as needed to abort seizure episodes (though note that if a patient with preeclampsia is having seizures, by definition, they have eclampsia).\n\nAl-Safi et al. discuss preeclampsia and eclampsia. They note that postpartum preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur within the first week after delivery. They recommend that mothers should be educated on what symptoms to look for.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT head may be indicated, in particular, if an intracranial hemorrhage was thought to be the cause of this patient\u2019s headache and vision changes. A subarachnoid hemorrhage would present with the classic \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache with blood in the subarachnoid space on head CT. A CTA may localize a bleeding aneurysm and a lumbar puncture would show an elevated red blood cell count in the CSF. It would not explain this patient\u2019s hypertension and abdominal pain. Note that a CT head is not a CTV which is specific venous imaging.\n\nAnswer B: Labetalol is an appropriate blood pressure medication to give in pregnancy; however, it is more appropriate to first give magnesium as this agent is neuroprotective and is the first-line agent of choice in preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer D: MRV head or a CTV head would be appropriate in the workup of cerebral venous thrombosis which is common in the setting of hypercoagulability (such as in the postpartum period) and presents with headache, blurry vision, and seizures. Note that it would not explain this patient\u2019s profound hypertension. It would be more reasonable to first empirically treat this patient's possible preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer E: Ondansetron and morphine would be appropriate symptomatic management of this patient but would not treat her underlying preeclampsia. It is more appropriate to first treat the life-threatening diagnosis before symptom management. If this patient\u2019s hypertension was thought to be due to pain, then morphine could be helpful.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPreeclampsia can occur in the postpartum period and should be managed with magnesium sulfate.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with nasal packing, hypotension, tachycardia, a dark, purpuric rash, and confusion, which are concerning for toxic shock syndrome. The most important initial step in management is to administer clindamycin.\n\nToxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening diagnosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and occurs commonly secondary to retained tampons or nasal packing. Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates. It is a relatively weaker antibiotic and would not be used in a critically ill patient with toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAnswers 4 & 5: Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin represent a powerful broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics that covers gram-positives, gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes (piperacillin-tazobactam) as well as further gram-positive coverage and MRSA (vancomycin). Though this is a potent antibiotic combination, neither of these takes priority over clindamycin given the possible benefit of toxin suppression from clindamycin. In this patient, clindamycin and piperacillin-tazobactam would be an appropriate antibiotic regimen.\n\nBullet Summary:\nClindamycin may suppress toxin production and should be given early in toxic shock syndrome.",

                "To analyze the question and options, let's break down the information provided and consider the possible diagnoses step-by-step.\n\n**A. Patient Presentation and History:**\n- The patient is a 7-year-old boy who has fainted several times during basketball practices.\n- He has no prodromes (warning signs) before fainting and is unconscious for less than a minute.\n- He is otherwise healthy, has met all developmental milestones, and is not on any medications.\n- Vital signs are within normal limits, and he appears well and playful during the physical exam.\n\n**B. Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n1. **Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD):**\n   - Typically presents in adolescents or young adults, not commonly in children.\n   - Characterized by ventricular arrhythmias, often with right ventricular involvement.\n   - ECG findings may show epsilon waves, but this is not specified here.\n\n2. **Brugada Syndrome:**\n   - Can cause syncope and is associated with characteristic ECG changes (coved ST segment elevation in V1-V3).\n   - More common in adults, but can present in children.\n   - Often has a genetic component, but no family history is mentioned.\n\n3. **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM):**\n   - Can cause syncope during exertion due to outflow obstruction.\n   - Often presents with a family history of sudden cardiac death.\n   - Echocardiogram would show hypertrophy, but ECG might show left ventricular hypertrophy or abnormal Q waves.\n\n4. **QT Prolongation:**\n   - Long QT syndrome can cause syncope due to torsades de pointes.\n   - ECG would show prolonged QT interval.\n   - Often has a genetic basis, but no family history is mentioned.\n\n5. **Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW):**\n   - Characterized by episodes of tachycardia due to an accessory pathway.\n   - ECG shows a short PR interval and delta wave.\n   - Can cause syncope during exertion.\n\n**C. Analysis of Options:**\n- The key to solving this question lies in the ECG findings, which are not provided in detail here. However, based on the common presentations:\n  - **WPW syndrome** is a likely candidate because it can cause syncope during exertion, and the ECG would show characteristic findings (short PR interval and delta wave).\n  - **HOCM** is also a possibility due to exertional syncope, but typically there would be a family history or signs of hypertrophy on ECG.\n  - **QT prolongation** would be evident on ECG with a prolonged QT interval.\n  - **Brugada syndrome** would show specific ECG changes, but is less common in children.\n  - **ARVD** is less likely given the age and typical presentation.\n\n**D. Conclusion:**\nGiven the scenario of exertional syncope in a child, the most likely diagnosis, assuming the ECG shows a short PR interval and delta wave, is **Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome**.\n\n**Answer:**\n(E) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome",

It is less likely in this age group and without specific ECG findings.\n\n3. **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM):**\n   - HOCM is a common cause of exertional syncope in young athletes due to dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. It can be diagnosed with echocardiography showing asymmetric septal hypertrophy.\n\n4. **QT Prolongation:**\n   - Long QT syndrome can lead to syncope and sudden cardiac death due to torsades de pointes. It would be identified by a prolonged QT interval on ECG.\n\n5. **Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome:**\n   - WPW syndrome is characterized by an accessory pathway leading to pre-excitation and tachyarrhythmias. It can cause syncope during exertion and is identified by a short PR interval and delta wave on ECG.\n\n**C. Analysis of Options:**\n- Without the ECG results, we must rely on the clinical presentation.

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",

Patient Presentation and Initial Assessment:**\n\n1. **Age and Symptoms:** The patient is a 70-year-old woman found on the floor, confused, with generalized pain. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight fever (99.2\u00b0F), normal blood pressure (129/64 mmHg), normal pulse (63/min), normal respirations (13/min), and good oxygen saturation (99% on room air).\n\n2. **Physical Exam:** She appears confused and ill, but her lungs are clear, suggesting no immediate respiratory distress.\n\n3. **Urinalysis:** The dipstick urinalysis shows 4+ blood and dark-colored urine, which is highly suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can occur due to prolonged immobility, muscle injury, or other causes, leading to muscle breakdown and release of myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can cause acute kidney injury.\n\n4. **ECG:** Although the ECG is not shown, the presence of rhabdomyolysis raises concern for potential electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, which can affect cardiac function.\n\n**B. Differential Diagnosis and Management Considerations:**\n\n1. **Rhabdomyolysis:** The presence of dark urine and significant blood on urinalysis without red blood cells suggests myoglobinuria, indicative of rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to acute kidney injury and electrolyte disturbances, especially hyperkalemia.\n\n2. **Hyperkalemia:** In rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia is a common complication due to the release of intracellular potassium from damaged muscle cells. Hyperkalemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias, which would be evident on the ECG.\n\n3. **Management Priorities:** The immediate management of rhabdomyolysis involves addressing potential hyperkalemia and preventing acute kidney injury. This typically includes:\n   - **IV fluid resuscitation** to maintain renal perfusion and promote excretion of myoglobin and potassium.\n   - **Calcium gluconate** to stabilize cardiac membranes if hyperkalemia is present.\n   - **Insulin and glucose** to drive potassium back into cells if hyperkalemia is confirmed.\n\n**C. Evaluation of Options:**\n\n- **(A) Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation:** Albuterol can help lower potassium levels, but it is not the primary treatment for rhabdomyolysis.\n- **(B) Calcium gluconate:** This is used to stabilize cardiac membranes in hyperkalemia, but without confirmation of hyperkalemia, it is not the first step.\n- **(C) Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation:** This combination addresses hyperkalemia and supports renal function, making it appropriate if hyperkalemia is suspected.\n- **(D) IV fluid resuscitation:** This is the most immediate and essential step in managing rhabdomyolysis to prevent acute kidney injury.\n- **(E) Sodium polystyrene sulfonate:** This is used to lower potassium levels but is not immediate and not the first-line treatment in acute settings.\n\n**D. Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the presentation of rhabdomyolysis and the need to prevent acute kidney injury, the most appropriate immediate step is IV fluid resuscitation. This will help maintain renal perfusion and facilitate the excretion of myoglobin and potassium.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n(D) IV fluid resuscitation",

Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight fever (99.2\u00b0F), normal blood pressure (129/64 mmHg), normal pulse (63/min), normal respirations (13/min), and normal oxygen saturation (99% on room air).\n\n2. **Physical Exam Findings:** She appears confused and ill, but her lungs are clear, which suggests no immediate respiratory distress.\n\n3. **Urinalysis Findings:** The dipstick urinalysis shows 4+ blood and dark-colored urine, which is highly suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury due to myoglobinuria.\n\n4. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Although the ECG is mentioned, the specific findings are not provided in the text. However, in the context of rhabdomyolysis, we should consider the possibility of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, which can cause ECG changes.\n\n**B. Differential Diagnosis and Management Considerations:**\n\n1. **Rhabdomyolysis:** The presence of dark urine and significant blood on urinalysis without red blood cells suggests myoglobinuria, indicative of rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to acute kidney injury and electrolyte disturbances, particularly hyperkalemia.\n\n2. **Hyperkalemia:** In rhabdomyolysis, muscle breakdown releases potassium into the bloodstream, potentially causing hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which might be reflected in the ECG findings.\n\n**C. Evaluation of Management Options:**\n\n1. **(A) Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation:** Albuterol can help lower potassium levels, but it is not the primary treatment for rhabdomyolysis.\n\n2. **(B) Calcium gluconate:** This is used to stabilize the cardiac membrane in cases of severe hyperkalemia, but it does not address the underlying cause or prevent further complications.\n\n3. **(C) Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation:** Insulin and glucose can help shift potassium into cells, addressing hyperkalemia, and IV fluids are crucial for preventing acute kidney injury in rhabdomyolysis.\n\n4. **(D) IV fluid resuscitation:** This is essential in managing rhabdomyolysis to prevent acute kidney injury by diluting and flushing out myoglobin and other toxins.\n\n5. **(E) Sodium polystyrene sulfonate:** This is used to remove potassium from the body but is not effective in acute settings and does not address rhabdomyolysis directly.\n\n**D.

The presence of myoglobin in the urine can cause this finding, as myoglobin can cause a false positive for blood on dipstick without red blood cells present in the urine sediment.\n\n2. **Immediate Concerns:**\n   - The primary concern in rhabdomyolysis is the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to myoglobinuria. This is typically managed with aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to maintain renal perfusion and facilitate the clearance of myoglobin from the kidneys.\n   - Another potential complication is hyperkalemia, which can occur due to the release of intracellular potassium from damaged muscle cells. Hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which would be evident on an ECG.\n\n3. **Management Priorities:**\n   - **IV Fluid Resuscitation:** This is the cornerstone of treatment for rhabdomyolysis to prevent AKI. It helps dilute nephrotoxic agents and supports renal function.\n   - **Hyperkalemia Management:** If hyperkalemia is present, it needs to be addressed promptly. Insulin and glucose can be used to drive potassium back into cells, temporarily lowering serum potassium levels.\n\n4. **ECG Consideration:**\n   - The question mentions an ECG was obtained, but without specific details on the findings. If the ECG shows changes suggestive of hyperkalemia (e.g., peaked T waves, widened QRS complex), this would necessitate immediate treatment for hyperkalemia.\n\n5. **Option Analysis:**\n   - **(A) Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation:** Albuterol can help lower potassium levels but is not the first-line treatment.\n   - **(B) Calcium gluconate:** Used to stabilize cardiac membranes in severe hyperkalemia but does not lower potassium levels.\n   - **(C) Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation:** Addresses both fluid resuscitation and potential hyperkalemia.\n   - **(D) IV fluid resuscitation:** Essential for preventing AKI but does not address hyperkalemia.\n   - **(E) Sodium polystyrene sulfonate:** Used for lowering potassium but is not suitable for acute management.\n\n### Updated Answer:\n\n**(C) Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation**\n\nThis option is the most comprehensive as it addresses both the prevention of acute kidney injury through IV fluid resuscitation and the potential hyperkalemia with insulin and glucose.

The dark urine and positive blood on urinalysis without red blood cells indicate myoglobin presence.\n\n3. **Immediate Management Priority:** The primary concern in rhabdomyolysis is preventing AKI. The most effective immediate intervention is IV fluid resuscitation. This helps dilute the myoglobin concentration in the blood and promotes renal clearance, reducing the risk of nephrotoxicity.\n\n4. **Analysis of Options:**\n   - **(A) Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation:** Albuterol is not relevant for rhabdomyolysis management.

It presents with stupor/obtundation, bradycardia, hemodynamic instability, and hypothermia. With a high clinical suspicion, appropriate history, physical exam, and vitals, it is appropriate to first treat the patient with IV hydrocortisone (or another highly potent steroid) and levothyroxine prior to confirming the diagnosis given the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.

He states that he has been working in a hot, humid attic all day and forgot his water bottle. He felt dizzy when standing up and then fainted and was unconscious for roughly 1 minute. He awoke at his neurologic baseline afterwards. The patient has a history of hypertension being managed by his primary care doctor. His temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 149/82 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a diaphoretic man. He demonstrates an unremarkable cardiopulmonary exam. The patient walks with a steady gait and his neurologic exam is non-focal. An ECG is performed as seen in Figure A. The patient is given 2 liters of oral fluids and feels back to his baseline.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with dizziness and syncope in the setting of likely dehydration (working in a hot/humid environment without water) and feels better after rehydration, suggesting a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. An ECG is performed and incidentally demonstrates a bifascicular block, which is at high risk of progressing to a complete heart block.\n\nBifascular block is a conduction abnormality in 2 of the 3 fascicles that conduct electricity from atria to ventricles. This leaves conduction to the ventricles via the single remaining fascicle. There are different possibilities that may present on ECG. One possibility is a right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block; the other is a right bundle branch block with a left posterior fascicular block. Note that the pathophysiology of complete heart block is an inability to conduct electricity from the atria to the ventricles. If there is only 1 fascicle left to conduct electricity, the patient would be in complete heart block if this fascicle were to no longer work, which is a common outcome in patients with bifascicular block. Treatment of complete heart block involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nWiberg et al. discuss bifascicular block. They note the possible outcome of a complete heart block. It is recommended to look for this finding on ECG and appropriately workup patients to prevent progression of disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bifascicular block. Note the left axis deviation as suggested by the net upward deflection of the QRS in lead I and net downward deflection in lead II (blue arrows). Then, note the appearance of a right bundle branch block with the RSR pattern in aVR (black arrow) and upward R\u2019 in lead V1 (green arrow). This is a classic pattern for bifascicular block. Contrast this to the other pattern of bifascicular block which would present with a right bundle branch block and right axis deviation (upward QRS in lead II and downward in lead I), which was not seen in this case.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atrial fibrillation may occur secondary to aging, hypertension, or ischemia and presents with an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with an absence of P waves. It may cause complications such as stroke. Management typically involves rate control agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction is a likely outcome in individuals with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, in particular, without proper preventive measures and medical therapy including statins, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors. This patient may be at risk of a myocardial infarction with his hypertension, and his underlying bifascicular block could suggest undiagnosed cardiac ischemia; however, it is more likely this patient progresses to complete heart block in the setting of his bifascicular block.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke is a possible complication of atrial fibrillation. For this reason, most patients with atrial fibrillation are on blood thinners to prevent this complication. It occurs secondary to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium. Patients are often risk stratified prior to starting blood thinners with tools such as CHADS2VASC and HASBLED. Isolated syncope is a rare manifestation of stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Torsades des pointes is a progression from QT prolongation which may occur secondary to genetic conditions, medications, and/or infection. It presents on ECG with QRS complexes that twist in amplitude around the electrical baseline. Treatment involves the administration of magnesium sulfate and, if needed, electrical cardioversion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA bifascicular block can progress to complete heart block.",

Patient Presentation and History:**\n- The patient is a 55-year-old man who fainted after working in a hot, humid environment without adequate hydration.\n- He has a history of hypertension.\n- His vital signs are relatively stable, with a slightly elevated blood pressure but normal temperature, pulse, respirations, and oxygen saturation.\n- He was diaphoretic (sweating), which is consistent with heat exposure and dehydration.\n- The neurologic exam is non-focal, and he returned to his baseline after rehydration.\n\n**B. Likely Diagnosis:**\n- The scenario suggests that the patient experienced syncope due to dehydration and possibly orthostatic hypotension from working in a hot environment without drinking water.\n- The fact that he felt better after oral rehydration supports this.\n\n**C. ECG Consideration:**\n- The question mentions an ECG was performed, but we don't have the image. However, the options suggest we consider potential ECG findings.\n- Common ECG findings in dehydration and syncope might include sinus tachycardia or possibly some electrolyte imbalances, but these are not directly listed in the options.\n\n**D. Analysis of Options:**\n1. **Atrial Fibrillation (A):** \n   - This is an irregular heart rhythm that can be triggered by stress, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances. However, the scenario does not strongly suggest atrial fibrillation, especially since the patient returned to baseline after rehydration.\n\n2. **Complete Heart Block (B):**\n   - This is a severe conduction issue that would likely present with more significant symptoms and not resolve with simple rehydration.\n\n3. **Myocardial Infarction (C):**\n   - The patient does not have chest pain or other classic symptoms of a heart attack, and his symptoms resolved with fluids, making this less likely.\n\n4. **Stroke (D):**\n   - The patient has no focal neurological deficits, and his symptoms resolved, making a stroke unlikely.\n\n5. **Torsades des Pointes (E):**\n   - This is a specific type of ventricular tachycardia often associated with prolonged QT interval, which can be exacerbated by electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) due to dehydration.\n\n**E. Conclusion:**\n- Given the context of dehydration and potential electrolyte imbalance, Torsades des Pointes (E) is a condition that could be precipitated by the patient's current state. Dehydration can lead to electrolyte disturbances, which in turn can prolong the QT interval and predispose to Torsades des Pointes.\n\n**Answer:**\n(E) Torsades des pointes",

Analysis of Potential Conditions:**\n1. **Atrial Fibrillation (A):** \n   - Typically presents with irregular heart rhythm and palpitations. The patient's pulse is regular, and there is no mention of palpitations or irregular rhythm.\n   - Less likely given the current presentation.\n\n2. **Complete Heart Block (B):**\n   - Would likely present with bradycardia and possibly syncope due to impaired conduction between atria and ventricles.\n   - The patient's pulse is normal, making this less likely.\n\n3. **Myocardial Infarction (C):**\n   - Would present with chest pain, possibly diaphoresis, and ECG changes such as ST elevation or depression.\n   - The patient does not report chest pain, and the ECG findings are not described as indicative of MI.\n\n4. **Stroke (D):**\n   - Would present with focal neurological deficits, which are absent in this patient.\n   - The patient returned to his neurologic baseline, making stroke unlikely.\n\n5. **Torsades des Pointes (E):**\n   - A form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with prolonged QT interval, often due to electrolyte imbalances.\n   - The patient's history of dehydration and fainting could suggest electrolyte imbalance, which can predispose to Torsades.\n\n**C. Conclusion:**\nGiven the patient's history of dehydration, fainting, and the potential for electrolyte imbalance, Torsades des Pointes is a plausible condition that could occur, especially if the ECG shows a prolonged QT interval.

Patient History and Symptoms:**\n1. **Age and Background:** The patient is a 55-year-old man with a history of hypertension.\n2. **Current Situation:** He fainted after working in a hot, humid environment without adequate hydration, which suggests dehydration and possibly heat exhaustion.\n3. **Symptoms:** He experienced dizziness upon standing, fainted, and was unconscious for about a minute. He returned to his neurologic baseline after regaining consciousness.\n4. **Vital Signs:** His temperature is normal, blood pressure is slightly elevated, pulse is normal, respirations are normal, and oxygen saturation is normal.\n5. **Physical Exam:** He is diaphoretic (sweating), but his cardiopulmonary and neurologic exams are unremarkable.\n\n**B. Analysis of ECG and Potential Conditions:**\n1. **ECG Findings:** The question mentions an ECG was performed but does not provide specific details about the findings. However, the options suggest potential arrhythmias or cardiac events.\n2. **Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance:** Working in a hot environment without hydration can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can affect cardiac function.\n\n**C. Evaluation of Options:**\n1. **Atrial Fibrillation (A):** This is an irregular heart rhythm that can be triggered by stress, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances. However, the question does not provide specific ECG findings indicative of atrial fibrillation.\n2. **Complete Heart Block (B):** This is a severe form of heart block where the electrical signals are completely blocked between the atria and ventricles. It would likely present with bradycardia and more severe symptoms.\n3. **Myocardial Infarction (C):** Typically presents with chest pain, and the ECG would show specific changes like ST elevation or depression. The patient's symptoms and history do not strongly suggest an MI.\n4. **Stroke (D):** The patient returned to his neurologic baseline, and his neurologic exam is non-focal, making a stroke unlikely.\n5. **Torsades des Pointes (E):** This is a specific type of ventricular tachycardia that can be triggered by electrolyte imbalances, particularly low magnesium or potassium, which could be related to dehydration.\n\n**D. Conclusion:**\nGiven the patient's history of working in a hot environment without hydration, the most likely condition related to dehydration and potential electrolyte imbalance is Torsades des Pointes.

He lost consciousness for about 30 seconds. When he woke up, he was mildly confused but able to ski down the rest of the mountain. The patient initially denied medical treatment but his wife convinced him to be taken by ambulance to the emergency department for evaluation. The paramedics report that at the scene the patient had a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15. During the ride, he became gradually more somnolent. His medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and a prior transient ischemic attack. His medications include atorvastatin and lisinopril. In the emergency department, his temperature is 97.8\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 141/84 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 16/min. He is difficult to arouse with a GCS of 7.

        "reason": "This patient presents with a lucid interval followed by worsening somnolence and a biconvex lesion on head CT, which suggests a diagnosis of acute epidural hematoma. Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death. Patients with neurologic findings or those with expanding bleeds require urgent surgical decompression.\n\nDadashi et al. present cases of patients with epidural hematoma from acute trauma. They discuss how patients often sustain these injuries from extreme sports. They recommend being aware of this syndrome so that acute interventions can be taken.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates a biconvex hyperdensity that is limited by suture lines (red circle). This is the typical appearance of an epidural hematoma on head CT.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Damage to the cerebral bridging veins results in a subdural hematoma (SDH). An acute SDH more commonly presents with a gradual increase in headache and confusion rather than the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome presented in this vignette. However, a minority of patients with acute SDH may have a lucid interval followed by progressive neurological decline. SDH would have a crescent-shaped appearance on head CT rather than the biconvex appearance of an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer C: Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries describes a lacunar stroke. Although this patient has 2 risk factors for lacunar stroke (hypertension and smoking), this patient\u2019s head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer D: A ruptured cerebral aneurysm would most likely lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subarachnoid hemorrhage presents as a sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap headache\u201d), confusion or somnolence, nausea and vomiting, and meningismus. Surgical clipping or embolization of the bleeding vessel may be required.\n\nAnswer E: Secondary hemorrhage into a prior area of infarction usually occurs in the setting of a recent embolic stroke. Although this patient has a history of TIA and other risk factors for stroke, his head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma. Treatment is supportive with the control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nBullet Summary:\nEpidural hematomas are caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery as it passes through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone.",

This gradual decline is characteristic of a subdural hematoma, where venous bleeding leads to a slow accumulation of blood.\n\n3. **Medical History**: The patient's history of hypertension and coronary artery disease may predispose him to vascular issues, but the acute nature of the presentation following trauma points more towards a traumatic cause rather than a spontaneous vascular event.\n\n4. **Head CT Findings**: Although the CT findings are not described in detail, the clinical presentation strongly suggests a subdural hematoma, which would appear as a crescent-shaped hyperdensity on the CT scan.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely cause of the patient's presentation is damage to the cerebral bridging veins, which is the typical cause of a subdural hematoma. This aligns with the gradual decline in consciousness following head trauma.\n\n- **Option A: Damage to the cerebral bridging veins** is consistent with a subdural hematoma, which matches the clinical presentation.\n- **Option B: Damage to the sphenoid bone** would be more associated with a basilar skull fracture and potentially an epidural hematoma, which typically presents with a lucid interval followed by rapid deterioration, not a gradual decline.\n- **Option C: Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries** is more indicative of a lacunar stroke, which does not fit the acute traumatic context.\n- **Option D: Ruptured cerebral aneurysm** would likely cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage, presenting with a sudden severe headache and rapid decline, not a gradual one.\n- **Option E: Secondary hemorrhage into prior area of infarction** is unlikely given the acute trauma and the lack of prior significant infarction history.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting option is:\n\n**Final Answer: A**",
        "final_thinking": "The scenario describes a man with a gradual decline in consciousness after a skiing accident, where he collided with a tree, suggesting a head injury likely resulting in a subdural hematoma due to damage to the cerebral bridging veins.

A digital rectal exam may temporarily relieve the obstruction and lead to the expulsion of gas and stool (the \u201csquirt sign\u201d). Abdominal radiography typically demonstrates signs of distal intestinal obstruction such as proximal dilation and an absence of air in the rectum. Contrast enema may reveal a transition zone between the dilated proximal megacolon and the narrow rectosigmoid colon. A biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with surgical removal of the defective segment of the bowel.\n\nKessman reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Hirschsprung disease. She discusses how the diagnosis can be made using a rectal suction biopsy. She recommends monitoring patients closely for enterocolitis for years after surgical treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an abdominal radiograph that demonstrates colonic distension (red circle). This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Duodenal atresia is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and may also present in the first 48 hours of life with bilious vomiting. The abdominal radiograph will demonstrate the \u201cdouble bubble\u201d sign, which reflects air trapping in the stomach and first portion of the duodenum. Treatment is with the surgical opening of the atretic segment.\n\nAnswer C: Intestinal malrotation may preset with bilious vomiting in a neonate due to the development of a midgut volvulus. An abdominal radiograph may show the extension of the nasogastric tube into an abnormally positioned duodenum and would not show diffuse colonic distension. Treatment is with surgical derotation of the volvulus.\n\nAnswer D: Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and also presents with delayed (> 48 hours) passing of meconium. The distal obstruction in these patients will not be temporarily relieved by a digital rectal exam. Contrast enema will demonstrate microcolon involving the entire large bowel. Treatment is with irrigation and removal of the meconium.\n\nAnswer E: Pyloric stenosis usually presents in the first 3-6 weeks of life with post-prandial, nonbilious, projectile vomiting and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastrium. This patient is presenting at just 2 days of life and has bilious vomiting. Treatment is with surgical release of the stenosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHirschsprung disease is associated with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and presents with retention of stool that can be relieved by digital disimpaction, bilious vomiting, and colonic distention on abdominal radiography.",

Bilious vomiting in a newborn is often indicative of an intestinal obstruction distal to the duodenum.\n\n2. **Stool Passage:** The patient has not passed any stool since birth, which is concerning for an obstruction or a motility issue.\n\n3. **Physical Exam Findings:** The patient has features suggestive of Down syndrome (upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, single transverse palmar crease). Down syndrome is associated with certain congenital conditions, including duodenal atresia.\n\n4. **Abdominal Exam:** The abdomen is non-tender, firm, and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds, indicating possible obstruction.\n\n5. **Digital Rectal Exam:** Evacuation of a small amount of stool and flatulence suggests that there is stool present but possibly obstructed or delayed in passage.\n\n6. **Radiograph:** Although the radiograph is not visible here, duodenal atresia typically shows a \"double bubble\" sign on abdominal X-ray due to gas in the stomach and proximal duodenum.\n\n**B. Option Analysis:**\n\n- **(A) Duodenal atresia:** This condition is characterized by bilious vomiting and is associated with Down syndrome. The \"double bubble\" sign on X-ray is classic for duodenal atresia.

It typically presents with delayed passage of meconium and abdominal distension. However, bilious vomiting is less common in Hirschsprung disease.\n\n- **(C) Intestinal malrotation:** This can cause bilious vomiting due to volvulus, but it is not specifically associated with Down syndrome.

A vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery was eventually performed. The child\u2019s Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia in the mother which was well-controlled throughout the pregnancy.

Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days. Treatment is supportive though patients may occasionally require phototherapy if they develop high levels of bilirubin. Transfusion is indicated if there is significant anemia present (though this is uncommon).\n\nJacob and Hoerter present evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with caput succedaneum. They discuss how this lesion commonly crosses cranial suture lines as well as the midline. They recommend differentiating this disease from more malignant etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage found in neonates, but they usually present with more serious signs of respiratory depression, apnea, or seizures. Patients with a subdural hematoma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Treatment of expanding lesions may require surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage, an uncommon but serious complication of traumatic birth. Like caput succedaneum, subgaleal hemorrhages occur most commonly in newborns delivered via vacuum-assisted delivery, but the swelling in a subgaleal hemorrhage involves the entire scalp. Patients may also present with signs of extensive blood loss and neurological disturbances. Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines. The treatment for these lesions is supportive as most of these lesions resolve spontaneously.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding into the lateral ventricles describes an intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with premature delivery and usually presents with neurological symptoms. Neurologic findings include seizures, apnea, respiratory depression, or asymmetric reflexes. Treatment may involve urgent surgical decompression to prevent herniation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCaput succedaneum is an extracranial injury caused by bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurotica in neonates.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a preceding viral illness, dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus (blood pressure drop from 150/85 to 130/70 mmHg during inspiration), an echocardiogram with impaired diastolic filling, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG. This constellation of symptoms is concerning for constrictive pericarditis.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic. In contrast to other types of pericarditis, in constrictive pericarditis, there is impaired diastolic filling and thus impaired cardiac function. There are many possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis including infection, inflammatory conditions, or idiopathic. Patients will present with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, a pericardial friction rub, and positional chest pain (usually worsened by laying back and relieved by leaning forward). Patients may also demonstrate jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, worsening dyspnea, and congestive hepatopathy. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, and an echocardiogram will demonstrate impaired diastolic filling and may demonstrate a thickened pericardium. The diagnosis can be supported with pulsus paradoxus (a drop of blood pressure by > 10 mmHg during inspiration).\n\nWelch reviews constrictive pericarditis. He discusses constrictive pericarditis and how the inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling possibly causing unexplained heart failure. Welch notes making the diagnosis is very challenging and requires meticulous echocardiograph assessment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates diffuse ST elevation (blue arrows) with PR depression (black arrows). This is consistent with pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, in the setting of infection, or in the setting of autoimmune disease and is more likely to occur with a rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid. While pulsus paradoxus would be present in this condition, muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans would be more likely to be seen on ECG. Echocardiography would demonstrate an echogenic rim of fluid around the heart.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction presents with chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, and ST elevation in a vascular distribution. Note that this patient\u2019s ST elevation is diffuse and there is no reciprocal ST depression. Moreover, the pattern of chest pain in myocardial infarction is typically exertional and not positional.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary embolism may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, hemoptysis, a history of hypercoagulability, and recent stasis or surgery (such as this patient\u2019s recent Achilles tendon surgery). It can cause obstructive shock leading to hypotension and tachycardia. Note that right heart strain and sinus tachycardia would be seen on ECG.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents very similarly to restrictive pericarditis. Note that in restrictive cardiomyopathy, patients will also have impaired diastolic filling; however, it is due to a myocardium that will not expand rather than the pericardium impairing filling. It can occur secondary to conditions such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis as well as other chronic inflammatory states. The ECG findings are nonspecific but may include low voltage QRS complexes, ST segment changes, T wave changes, bundle branch blocks, and pathologic Q waves (abnormally deep and wide Q waves). The diagnosis can be supported with an ultrasound demonstrating impaired diastolic filling and possible myocardial speckling if a protein (amyloid) is present and deposited in the myocardial wall. The diagnosis can only definitively be confirmed with a biopsy which is highly invasive.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRestrictive pericarditis presents with chest pain that is positional, pulsus paradoxus, a friction rub, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG.",

        "reason": "This patient with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is presenting with respiratory distress (increased work of breathing, hypoxia, wheezes, and crackles) in the setting of atrial fibrillation (ECG with irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves) with rapid ventricular response and pulmonary edema on chest radiograph. Digoxin is an appropriate medication that can both control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation and increase cardiac contractility and potentially improve respiratory symptoms in this decompensated patient with heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation presents on ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. The initial management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate control. If the patient is stable, possible first-line agents include beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem). These agents may reduce cardiac contractility and worsen complications such as pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when the patient is in a decompensated state. If the patient has a reduced ejection fraction and requires rate control, then digoxin is a highly effective medication that blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should immediately be cardioverted.\n\nMoskowitz et. al review the management of atrial fibrillation. They note that in the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metoprolol is commonly used in the intensive care setting, is more successful than amiodarone, and had better rate control when compared to diltiazem.\n\nEhle et. al note that digoxin is approved to control ventricular response in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and is the only oral agent with positive inotropic effects approved for the management of mild to moderate heart failure.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating an irregularly irregular rate/rhythm (note the spacing of the blue arrows indicating the QRS complexes) without P waves, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Figure B is a chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral, hazy interstitial infiltrates, which are concerning for pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and prednisone would be appropriate management of a COPD flare, which presents in a patient with a history of smoking with dyspnea, wheezing, increased work of breathing, and a barrel chest. While this patient\u2019s wheezing may be secondary to his COPD, it is much more likely to be a cardiac wheeze given his chest radiograph findings including pulmonary edema. Treating his atrial fibrillation is more likely to alleviate his pulmonary symptoms. Other treatments in COPD include ipratropium and BiPAP.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem would be an appropriate rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of a COPD flare as it will not impair the mechanism of albuterol (which should be given as a nebulizer in COPD flares). In this patient, further impairing cardiac contractility with a calcium channel blocker may worsen his underlying pulmonary edema (given his reduced ejection fraction).\n\nAnswer D: Intubation would be indicated if this patient\u2019s respiratory status were worsening, including failure to oxygenate, failure to ventilate, or impending respiratory failure. This patient\u2019s respiratory status has improved on BiPAP; thus intubation is not needed.\n\nAnswer E: Metoprolol, like diltiazem, would reduce cardiac contractility and may worsen pulmonary edema, in particular, in a patient with a reduced ejection fraction. It also may cause COPD symptoms to emerge, as beta-2 blockade may cause bronchoconstriction (even though metoprolol is beta-1 selective). It would be indicated as outpatient rate control for a patient with atrial fibrillation who can tolerate a beta-blocker, and is preferred in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, as it reduces mortality.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with a reduced ejection fraction may be optimally managed with digoxin, which blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility.",

        "reason": "This postmenopausal patient is presenting with vulvovaginal dryness and irritation, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infections, likely due to genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). The most appropriate initial treatment is symptomatic relief with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nReduced estrogen levels after menopause lead to vulvovaginal atrophy by causing reduced blood flow and collagen content in vulvovaginal tissues. Patients typically have thin vulvar skin and loss of vaginal tissue pliability. The bladder and urethral epithelium may also atrophy leading to dysuria and urinary frequency. Atrophic tissue becomes thin, dry, and susceptible to injury. The first line of treatment is vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If this does not improve symptoms, the next step in treatment is vaginal estrogen to help restore blood flow in vulvovaginal tissues. Finally, hormone replacement therapy is indicated if symptoms are refractory to all other modalities.\n\nBhupathiraju et al. studied the association between vaginal estrogen and chronic disease risk. The authors found no association between low-dose vaginal estrogen and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and hip fractures over an 18-year period. The authors recommended that low-dose vaginal estrogen can be used indefinitely without concomitant progestin therapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole is the treatment for trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis. While patients with trichomoniasis can present with cervical petechiae and punctate hemorrhages, they typically also have frothy green discharge (absent in this patient). While patients with bacterial vaginosis can also have vaginal discharge, the discharge is typically malodorous and symptoms of pruritis are generally absent.\n\nAnswer B: Nitrofurantoin is the treatment of choice for urinary tract infections. While this patient has increased urinary frequency and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, her normal urinalysis makes the diagnosis of urinary tract infection unlikely.\n\nAnswer C: Topical clobetasol cream is the treatment for lichen sclerosis. While lichen sclerosis can present with pain with intercourse and vulvar pruritis, patients often have plaques that disrupt the normal vulvar architecture. Lichen sclerosis does not affect the vaginal tissues.\n\nAnswer D: Topical estrogen is the treatment of choice for cases of vulvovaginal atrophy resistant to treatment with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. This patient should first be trialed on vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nBullet Summary:\nVulvovaginal atrophy is initially treated with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.",

        "reason": "This patient's progressively increasing PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex on ECG is consistent with second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, Mobitz type I, also referred to as Wenckebach phenomenon.\n\nSecond degree AV block, Mobitz type I can occur in a variety of settings, such as in the context of digoxin, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or increased vagal tone. On ECG, there is progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex (a dropped beat); then, the PR interval resets. Patients are typically asymptomatic, but should undergo evaluation for an underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia, such as electrolyte imbalances, medication side effect, or structural heart disease, as well as a follow-up ECG to evaluate for any progression. If the dysrhythmia is caused by medication, the offending agent should be discontinued, but otherwise there are no specific treatments necessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic and hemodynamically stable can undergo telemetry monitoring and receive atropine with limited efficacy. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and not responsive to atropine may need cardiac pacing. Generally, there is a low risk of progression to third degree AV block, and a pacemaker is rarely required (in contrast to second degree heart block type II).\n\nBarold and Hayes review second-degree heart block. They note the changes in AV node conduction time on ECG in this condition. They recommend using the correct definition of the different heart blocks for the correct underlying treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG showing PR intervals that gradually prolong until a P wave is seen not followed by a QRS complex (note the blue bars that show the progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until the dropped beat).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: First degree AV block is seen on ECG with prolonged PR intervals greater than 0.2 sec, but a consistent 1:1 ratio of P waves to QRS complexes. This finding is typically found in younger patients with increased vagal tone or in athletes, and does not require treatment.\n\nAnswer C: Second degree AV block, Mobitz type II is seen with fixed PR intervals and occasional dropped QRS complexes. Patients with Mobitz II sometimes present with syncope and frequently progress to third degree AV block. This finding may be associated with fibrotic changes to the conduction system or from acute, subacute, or prior myocardial infarction, and should be treated with placement of a pacemaker in most cases.\n\nAnswer D: Sinus bradycardia findings on ECG include normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Patients with sinus bradycardia may be asymptomatic, but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness, chest pain, or hypotension. No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic, but atropine may be given to increase the heart rate in symptomatic cases. Pacemaker placement is required for patients with chronic symptoms.\n\nAnswer E: Third-degree AV block occurs when the atria and ventricles depolarize independently on ECG. There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. Patients may present with syncope, dizziness, acute heart failure, or hypotension. The treatment is pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSecond degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type I, is characterized by progressively lengthening PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex.",

These are not directly relevant to the current presentation.\n3. **Vital Signs:** Mild fever (99.5\u00b0F), hypertension (150/100 mmHg), normal pulse, respirations, and oxygen saturation.\n4. **Physical Exam:** Mild systolic murmur, otherwise normal.\n5. **Laboratory Findings:**\n   - **Hemoglobin:** 12 g/dL (slightly low, indicating possible anemia)\n   - **Hematocrit:** 36% (consistent with mild anemia)\n   - **Leukocyte count:** 66,500/mm^3 (markedly elevated, indicating leukocytosis)\n   - **Platelet count:** 177,000/mm^3 (normal)\n   - **Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase:** Elevated\n   - **Electrolytes and other serum values:** Mostly normal, except slightly elevated calcium (10.9 mEq/L)\n\n**B. Analysis of Options:**\n1. **Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (A):** Typically presents with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone pain. The leukocyte count is usually not as high as seen here, and the differential would show immature lymphoid cells. The normal differential and elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase do not support this diagnosis.\n\n2. **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B):** Characterized by lymphocytosis, often with a high white blood cell count. However, the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is usually normal or low, not elevated. The presentation does not match CLL.\n\n3. **Chronic myeloid leukemia (C):** Typically presents with marked leukocytosis, often exceeding 50,000/mm^3, and elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase. The presence of a mild systolic murmur could be incidental but is not uncommon in CML due to increased blood flow. The elevated calcium is not typical for CML but can occur. The presentation fits CML well.\n\n4. **Leukemoid reaction (D):** This is a reactive process with elevated white blood cell count, often due to infection or stress. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is elevated, which fits, but the clinical presentation with weight loss and abdominal pain is less typical for a leukemoid reaction.\n\n5. **Multiple myeloma (E):** Typically presents with bone pain, anemia, renal dysfunction, and hypercalcemia. The leukocyte count is usually normal or low, not elevated. The elevated calcium could fit, but the leukocytosis does not support this diagnosis.\n\n**C. Conclusion:**\nBased on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Chronic myeloid leukemia (C)**. The markedly elevated leukocyte count with normal differential and elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase are characteristic of CML.\n\n**Answer:**\n(C) Chronic myeloid leukemia",

        "reason": "This patient\u2019s new-onset palpitations, irregularly irregular pulse, and absent p-waves on ECG are consistent with atrial fibrillation. In hemodynamically stable patients with a relative contraindication to \u03b2-blockers (COPD on home oxygen with increasing oxygen need), rate control with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil is preferred.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can present with palpitations, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. ECG findings will be an irregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves with an erratic baseline as shown in Illustration A. Treatment is centered on rate control. First-line agents for rate control include \u03b21 selective blockers (metoprolol and esmolol) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem). In patients with COPD, non-selective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol, timolol, and sotalol) can worsen bronchoconstriction by activating \u03b22-adrenoreceptors. Other relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers include Raynaud disease and depression (increased risk of fatigue and sexual dysfunction). In patients with relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred initial treatment option.\n\nVan Gelder et al. studied lenient (resting heart rate < 110 beats per minute) versus strict rate control (resting heart rate < 80 beats per minute) in patients with atrial fibrillation in a randomized control trial. The authors found that there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmias between the 2 groups. The authors recommend a lenient rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG lacking P waves (red arrows) and irregularly irregular RR intervals (red/blue lines), which are classic findings in atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic that can be used in patients to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It is often suitable to use in patients with depressed left ventricular function. Amiodarone has multiple multi-system adverse effects including pulmonary toxicity, and it is not used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer B: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that can be used to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Although patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, the preferred anticoagulation agents are warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban).\n\nAnswer C: Digoxin can be used as a rate control agent in atrial fibrillation as it directly suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction. Due to its narrow therapeutic window and risk of toxicity, it is used as second-line therapy when first-line agents fail.\n\nAnswer D: Metoprolol is a \u03b2-blocker that is a first-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. In patients with contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice. This patient has COPD with increasing oxygen needs making calcium channel blockers possibly a better choice.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn hemodynamically stable patients with atrial fibrillation and relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden onset confusion, slurred speech, asymmetric smile, and weakness in the setting of risk factors for stroke (atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and hypertension). The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin. Factor concentrate can also be used to rapidly reverse anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain would be indicated in the workup of a stroke or transient ischemic attack after all emergency interventions and labs including CT head, serum chemistries, CBC, and ECG. It delineates the extent of the stroke and gives useful prognostic and diagnostic information. It also may elucidate strokes missed on other forms of neuroimaging such as CT perfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA fingerstick blood glucose should be obtained immediately in all patients with stroke-like symptoms or altered mental status.",

        "reason": "This patient with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, deviation of the tongue to the right, left-sided hemiparesis, and decreased sensation to light touch and vibration on the left side of his body most likely has a stroke of the right medial medulla. The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation. Treatment includes reperfusion via thrombolytics if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of the time last known well.\n\nKim and Han present clinical findings, radiographic findings, angiographic data, and long-term outcomes from a case series of 86 patients with medial medullary infarction. The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome). This leads to lesions to the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Clinically this presents with dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased gag reflex, vomiting, vertigo, decreased pain and temperature sensation from the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, and ipsilateral ataxia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOcclusion of the anterior spinal artery can lead to medial medullary syndrome, which presents with ipsilateral deviation of the tongue, contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities, and contralateral loss of light touch and vibration sensation.",

Patients classically present with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Atypical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction may include abdominal pain, nausea, reflux symptoms, and dizziness. The most important initial step in management is to administer aspirin as it lowers mortality and carries minimal risk. An ECG should then be performed. Classically, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will demonstrate ST elevations in a vascular distribution. However, the progression to a STEMI is usually stepwise and may present with ST depressions, hyperacute T waves, pseudonormalization of the ST segment (a normal ST segment after a depression as it elevates), ST elevations, and finally tombstoning (a concave down wave that looks like a tombstone). If a STEMI is suspected after an ECG is performed, the patient should be started on a second antiplatelet agent (e.g., ticagrelor), heparin, and sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\nNable et al. review the typical electrophysiologic changes found in STEMI. The authors note that T-wave inversions and ST-segment depression can before, during, or after the STEMI event. The authors recommend obtaining serial ECGs in patients with suspected STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates hyperacute T waves (blue arrows) that are only occurring in a vascular distribution (V2-V6).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia can present with peaked T waves; however, peaked T waves would be demonstrated in all leads. Other findings of hyperkalemia can include QRS widening. Immediate management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes should include calcium administration followed by drugs that shift potassium intracellularly such as insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate. Further management may include diuresis and/or dialysis.\n\nAnswer B: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may demonstrate increased voltages throughout the ECG, in particular, in leads V2-V6 with deep Q waves in the septal leads. It may present with syncope upon exertion in a young patient (and in rare cases, sudden cardiac death). Ultrasound would show hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Management involves staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activities, and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Hypokalemia can present initially on ECG with U waves and may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias. Repletion with potassium is the preferred treatment, and the magnesium level should be checked as low magnesium can lead to potassium wasting in the kidneys.\n\nAnswer E: Pericarditis presents with chest pain worse by laying back and relieved by leaning forward. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions, and echocardiography may demonstrate a pericardial effusion. Management involves the administration of ibuprofen or colchicine and steroids in refractory cases. However, these therapies should not be used after myocardial infarction.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHyperacute T waves are an early finding that is concerning for myocardial infarction.",

However, the positional nature of the pain is not typical for HOCM. Additionally, the physical exam might reveal a systolic murmur, which is not mentioned here.\n\n(C) **Hypokalemia**: Can cause muscle weakness, cramps, and ECG changes like U waves, but does not typically cause chest pain that is positional in nature.\n\n(D) **Myocardial infarction (MI)**: Presents with chest pain, often described as pressure or squeezing, and can be associated with shortness of breath and syncope. However, the positional nature of the pain (worse when leaning back, better when leaning forward) is not typical for MI.\n\n(E) **Pericarditis**: Classically presents with chest pain that is sharp or pleuritic, and the pain is often relieved by sitting up and leaning forward.

However, we can infer that the finding is likely related to a common condition associated with the patient's history or medications.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Patient's Background:**\n   - The patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of depression.\n   - He is currently being treated with fluoxetine (an SSRI) and lithium (a mood stabilizer).\n\n2. **Vital Signs:**\n   - Temperature: 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C) - slightly elevated, but not significantly febrile.\n   - Blood pressure: 122/78 mmHg - normal.\n   - Pulse: 90/min - normal.\n   - Respirations: 13/min - normal.\n   - Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air - normal.\n\n3. **Medications:**\n   - **Fluoxetine:** Common side effects include nausea, headache, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction.\n   - **Lithium:** Known for causing side effects such as tremor, increased thirst, and potential renal issues. It can also cause dermatological issues like acne or psoriasis.\n\n4. **Potential Conditions:**\n   - Given the medications, lithium is more likely to be associated with a notable physical finding. Lithium can cause dermatological conditions such as acne or psoriasis, which could be the finding in Figure A.\n\n5. **Options Analysis:**\n   - **(A) Alcohol consumption:** Could exacerbate depression or interact with medications but is not directly linked to a dermatological condition.\n   - **(B) Antibiotic use:** Not relevant to the patient's current medication or history.\n   - **(C) Intravenous drug use:** Could lead to skin infections or track marks, but there's no indication of drug use in the history.\n   - **(D) Poor dental hygiene:** Unlikely to be related to a dermatological finding.\n   - **(E) Sexual intercourse:** Could be related to sexually transmitted infections, but these are less likely to be directly linked to the medications or the patient's history.\n\n6. **Most Likely Risk Factor:**\n   - Considering the patient's use of lithium and the common side effects, the most likely risk factor for a dermatological condition (such as acne) would be related to the medication itself rather than lifestyle factors like alcohol or sexual activity.\n\n**Answer:**\n(D) Poor dental hygiene\n\nUpon further reflection, the answer should be reconsidered. The most likely risk factor for a dermatological condition associated with lithium use is not poor dental hygiene but rather the medication itself. However, since the options provided do not include medication as a choice, the analysis may need to be revisited with the assumption that the finding in Figure A is related to a condition like acne, which is not directly listed in the options. Therefore, the correct answer should be based on the most plausible indirect association, which is not clearly provided in the options.",

However, without specific symptoms or findings related to alcohol use, this is less likely to be the primary risk factor.\n  \n- **(B) Antibiotic use:** Antibiotic use is typically associated with side effects like gastrointestinal disturbances or antibiotic resistance. It is not commonly linked to a specific physical exam finding unless there is a history of recent antibiotic use leading to a condition like Clostridium difficile infection, which would present with gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n- **(C) Intravenous drug use:** This is a significant risk factor for conditions such as infective endocarditis, skin infections, and transmission of blood-borne pathogens (e.g., HIV, hepatitis). If Figure A shows signs like track marks, skin abscesses, or signs of endocarditis (e.g., Janeway lesions, Osler nodes), this would be a strong consideration.\n\n- **(D) Poor dental hygiene:** Poor dental hygiene is a risk factor for dental caries, periodontal disease, and potentially infective endocarditis if there is a dental source of bacteremia. If Figure A shows dental issues or signs of endocarditis, this could be relevant.\n\n- **(E) Sexual intercourse:** This is a risk factor for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If Figure A shows signs of an STI (e.g., genital lesions, rash), this would be relevant.\n\n**Inference:**\nGiven the options and the context, the most likely conditions that would have a notable physical exam finding and are linked to a specific risk factor are related to intravenous drug use or poor dental hygiene, both of which can lead to infective endocarditis. Without the image, we must infer based on common presentations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nConsidering the patient's age, medical history, and the options provided, intravenous drug use is a significant risk factor for conditions that would present with notable physical exam findings, such as infective endocarditis.

Supportive care is the most appropriate management strategy for patients with viral meningitis.\n\nAseptic (viral) meningitis presents similarly to bacterial meningitis with neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, malaise, and flu-like symptoms. Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose. CSF should be sent for Gram stain and culture to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial meningitis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, management of viral meningitis consists of supportive care and monitoring for complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or SIADH.\n\nKohil et. al review viral meningitis.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden, painless, unilateral vision loss with a fundoscopic exam positive for venous dilation and retinal hemorrhage. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of retinal vein occlusion.\n\nRetinal vein occlusion can occur in either central or branch retinal veins and is often caused by compression from nearby arterial atherosclerosis. It presents as acute onset, painless vision loss, normally in one eye. On fundoscopic exam, classic findings of this disease include venous engorgement, retinal hemorrhage, cotton wool exudates, and edema/swelling of the optic disk can be seen. There is no definitive treatment for this disorder but symptomatic treatment includes intravitreal glucocorticoid injections and retinal laser photocoagulation. Retinal vein occlusion may resolve spontaneously or progress to permanent vision loss.\n\nRobinson and Halpern present evidence regarding the treatment of retinal vein occlusion. They discuss how the treatments for the acute phase of this disease have been disappointing. They recommend managing long-term complications such as neovascularization with phototherapy.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a fundoscopic exam showing engorged retinal veins, optic disk swelling, and widespread retinal hemorrhages (red circle). These findings are characteristic of central retinal vein occlusion.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Central retinal artery occlusion can present as sudden onset, unilateral vision loss. Fundoscopic exam will show a \u201ccherry-red\u201d spot at the fovea and a \u201cfuzzy\u201d retina with attenuated vessels. Embolic sources may include carotid artery atherosclerosis or cardiac vegetation. Treatment is with risk factor control.\n\nAnswer B: Closed-angle glaucoma presents as sudden, painful, vision loss caused by increased intraocular pressure. The eye will appear red and often feel \u201chard.\u201d The optic disc will show characteristic cupping. Intraocular pressure will be levated and treatment is with acetazolamide, steroids, timolol, bromidine, and pilocarpine. Irodotomy is reserved for refractory cases.\n\nAnswer C: Papilledema may present as an enlargement in the blind spot and is usually bilateral, as it is caused by increased intracranial pressure. On fundoscopic exam, there will be bilateral optic disk swelling, seen as an elevated optic disk and blurred margins. Patients should undergo a neurologic evaluation to determine the etiology of the papilledema.\n\nAnswer D: Retinal detachment presents as monocular loss of vision, often described as a \u201ccurtain pulled down,\u201d and preceded by \u201cflashers\u201d and \u201cfloaters.\u201d On fundoscopic exam, crinkling of the retinal tissue and abrupt changes in vessel direction can be seen. Surgical reattachment of the retina is required to prevent loss of vision.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRetinal vein occlusion presents with a sudden, monocular, painless loss of vision with optic disk swelling, dilated veins, cotton wool spots, and retinal hemorrhages.",

In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin.

Cefoxitin is a cephalosporin with some anaerobic coverage, but doxycycline is more commonly used for atypical bacteria and not for postpartum infections.\n   - **Option (B) Clindamycin and gentamicin**: This combination is the standard empirical treatment for postpartum endometritis. Clindamycin provides excellent anaerobic coverage, while gentamicin covers aerobic gram-negative bacteria.\n   - **Option (C) Supportive therapy only**: Given the symptoms and risk factors, supportive therapy alone would not be sufficient.\n   - **Option (D) Vancomycin and clindamycin**: This combination is more appropriate for severe infections with suspected resistant gram-positive organisms, such as MRSA, which is not the primary concern here.\n   - **Option (E) Vancomycin and gentamicin**: This combination is typically used for severe infections with resistant organisms, not for standard postpartum endometritis.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The combination of clindamycin and gentamicin (Option B) provides the necessary broad-spectrum coverage for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria typically involved in postpartum endometritis.

They can cause urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. The diagnosis is made clinically with the appropriate history (vaginal discharge, high-risk sexual behavior) and physical exam (purulent cervical discharge +/- cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness). The diagnosis should be confirmed with PCR; however, this should not delay treatment.

        "reason": "Based on the presence of both hemoglobin (Hb) A and S on gel electrophoresis, this patient has sickle cell trait. Episodes of painless hematuria are commonly seen in these patients.\n\nSickle cell trait is a condition that refers to carrying 1 normal and 1 abnormal beta-globin allele. On electrophoresis, this will present as 3 different bands consisting of about 50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin). HbF decreases significantly after the first 6 weeks of life. Individuals with sickle cell trait tend to be asymptomatic and do not have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population. However, they are at higher risk of some conditions. Patients are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous physical activity and may have episodic painless hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis. The hyperosmolar, acidotic, and hypoxic environment of the renal medulla is thought to trigger red cell sickling which results in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. Patients with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. These patients should receive reproductive counseling and use appropriate preventive measures to prevent dehydration during intensive exercise.\n\nHulsizer et al. studied the association between sickle cell trait and common medical conditions using insurance claims data. The authors found that sickle cell trait is associated with increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and retinopathy. The authors recommend further evaluation of these associations using prospective studies derived from clinical data.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows gel electrophoresis with an example of a normal (95-98% HbA and < 2% HbF), sickle cell trait (50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF), and sickle cell anemia (85-95% HbS and 5-15% HbF) patient from left to right.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Diabetes has not been associated with sickle cell trait in the majority of studies.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is a complication of sickle cell anemia. Mechanisms include functional asplenism, reduced tissue perfusion during a sickle crisis, and chronic transfusions with an indwelling catheter. Common infections include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitis. Sickle cell trait is not clearly associated with an increased risk of infection and actually confers some protection against malaria.\n\nAnswer D: Splenectomy from auto-infarction is often seen in sickle cell anemia, but it is rare with sickle cell trait. In sickle cell anemia, splenic sequestration of sickled red blood cells causes infarction, leading to progressive atrophy and functional hyposplenism. Most individuals with sickle cell disease are functionally asplenic by age 2 to 4. The spleen subsequently cannot phagocytose encapsulated organisms properly, which predisposes sickle cell patients to infection.\n\nAnswer E: Stroke is a complication of sickle cell anemia but not sickle cell trait. This is due to the increased viscosity of the blood and reduced deformability of red cells in patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSickle cell trait is associated with episodes of painless hematuria.",

In sickle cell disease, particularly in infants and young children, one of the most significant complications is the increased risk of infections. This is primarily due to functional asplenia, which occurs because the sickled red blood cells can cause splenic infarctions, leading to a loss of splenic function. The spleen plays a crucial role in filtering bacteria and mounting an immune response, so its dysfunction significantly heightens the risk of infections, especially from encapsulated organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.\n\nAll three medical experts in the debate have emphasized the risk of infection as the most immediate and likely complication for a child of this age with sickle cell disease. Their consensus is based on the understanding that functional asplenia is a common early complication in sickle cell disease, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.\n\nGiven the information and expert opinions, the most likely complication for this 6-week-old boy with sickle cell disease is indeed infection.

        "reason": "This young, healthy patient is presenting with constant vertigo, ataxia, vomiting, and a head impulse test revealing a corrective saccade, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) exam, which suggests a peripheral etiology of vertigo, most likely vestibular neuritis. As the diagnosis can be made clinically, steroids are the only treatment needed.\n\nDifferentiating peripheral (the vestibular system) versus central (the brain) vertigo is critical in management. Peripheral vertigo is commonly caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Vertigo that is constant is more consistent with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis but could also be a cerebellar stroke. To differentiate, age, risk factors, and onset of symptoms are critical. Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam. They note how it can be used to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo. It is recommended to perform this exam when differentiating central versus peripheral vertigo.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 3: Head imaging such as a CT head or MRI brain is not necessary in patients with a clear peripheral cause of their vertigo/dizziness with a HINTS exam suggesting a peripheral etiology. Clinically, this patient has vestibular neuritis and can be treated accordingly. Imaging would be needed if the patient had an acute cerebellar stroke.\n\nAnswer D: The Epley maneuver is only indicated in cases of benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo, which presents with severe vertigo (with changes in head position) that diminish with time and keeping the head stationary. Note that this patient\u2019s Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative and that his vertigo is constant rather than intermittent or positional.\n\nAnswer E: Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated within 4.5 hours in the setting of an ischemic stroke after a head CT rules out a head bleed, other reversible causes are treated, and assuming there are no contraindications to thrombolytics. Tissue plasminogen activator can be given in posterior circulation strokes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPeripheral causes of vertigo generally do not require head imaging, and causes such as labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis can be treated with steroids.",

        "reason": "This patient with confusion, dark urine, and peaked T waves on electrocardiogram in the setting of a prolonged time spent down likely has developed rhabdomyolysis with associated hyperkalemia. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",

        "reason": "This patient presents with tall stature, mucosal neuromas of the lips and tongue, an isolated thyroid nodule, and a family history of thyroid disease, which suggests a diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2B). MEN2B is also associated with pheochromocytomas, which cause elevated plasma metanephrines.\n\nMEN2B is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the RET proto-oncogene and presents with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pheochromocytoma, Marfanoid habitus, and mucosal neuromas. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs in almost all patients with MEN2B and is often metastatic at the time of diagnosis. Patients should be screened for pheochromocytoma using plasma fractionated metanephrines at the time of diagnosis of MTC. Intestinal neuromas may also lead to intestinal manifestations such as chronic constipation and megacolon. Treatment is with surgical excision of malignant lesions and active screening for future development of tumors.\n\nCastinetti et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of MEN2B. They discuss how often the first presentation of this disease involves the diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma. They recommend developing techniques for earlier diagnosis of this disease in order to allow for better survival.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating mucosal neuromas, which are painless nodules on the lips or tongue (red circles). These findings are characteristically seen in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: An elevated serum calcium level would suggest parathyroid hyperplasia, which is a feature of both type 1 and type 2A multiple endocrine neoplasia. Rather than hypercalcemia, this patient is likely to have an elevated serum calcitonin level due to his medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nAnswer C: An elevated serum prolactin level would suggest the presence of a prolactinoma, which is a pituitary tumor that may be seen in type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN1). Other findings in this disorder include parathyroid and pancreatic tumors. Treatment is with surgical excision of malignant lesions.\n\nAnswer D: Fasting hypoglycemia would suggest the presence of an insulinoma, which is a less common pancreatic tumor that may be seen in MEN1. Other findings in this disorder include parathyroid and pancreatic tumors. Patients with an insulinoma require surgical excision in order to allow for proper glucose homeostasis.\n\nAnswer E: A positive fecal occult blood test would raise suspicion for colorectal cancer, which is a feature of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS). The extraintestinal manifestations of PJS include mucocutaneous pigmented macules on the lips and perioral region. Treatment is with screening for colorectal cancer and surgical excision of malignant lesions.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B presents with medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, Marfanoid habitus, and mucosal neuromas.",

These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced.

Given the patient's CAD history, adding lisinopril could be a reasonable step for further cardiovascular risk reduction.\n\n3. **(C) Add nifedipine:** Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker used for hypertension and angina. It is not typically first-line for CAD management post-ACS, especially when the patient is already on a beta-blocker.\n\n4. **(D) Continue current medications and schedule follow-up:** The patient is stable, compliant, and reports improvement. Continuing the current regimen and monitoring is a conservative approach, ensuring no adverse effects or new symptoms arise.\n\n5. **(E) Switch beta-blocker to carvedilol:** Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with additional alpha-blocking properties, often used in heart failure management. If the patient had heart failure symptoms or issues with metoprolol, switching might be considered, but there is no indication of such issues here.\n\n**C. Conclusion:**\nGiven the patient's stable condition, compliance, and improvement, the most appropriate next step is to optimize cardiovascular protection. Adding an ACE inhibitor like lisinopril can provide additional benefits in terms of cardiovascular risk reduction, especially post-ACS, without altering the current stable regimen.\n\n**Answer:**\n(B) Add lisinopril",

She feels more irritable with her husband and children and does not find pleasure in creating art anymore. Over the last 2 weeks, she has been sleeping approximately 5 hours a night and had a fall while walking in her home with the lights off. She denies any head trauma or loss of consciousness associated with the fall. She has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and hypothyroidism for which she takes escitalopram and levothyroxine. She had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 5 years ago. She has been in a monogamous relationship with her husband for the last 15 years and uses a copper intrauterine device. Physical examination is notable for a depressed affect. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. She has 4/5 strength in the bilateral lower extremities and brisk patellar reflexes.

        "reason": "This patient's mood changes and findings concerning for subacute combined degeneration (fall in the dark, impaired proprioception, weakness, and brisk patellar reflexes), and history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery are concerning for vitamin B12 deficiency. Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection. The spirochete leads to disease in the posterior columns (vibration and proprioception sensation). Patients present with sensory ataxia (similar to subacute combined degeneration), lancinating pain (in the limbs, back, or face), and an Argyll-Robertson pupil (impaired pupillary constriction to light but intact pupillary constriction to accommodation).\n\nAnswer C: Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin are seen in patients with major depressive disorder which does not cause sensory ataxia with brisk reflexes.\n\nAnswer E: Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose would result in hypothyroidism, which can present with depressed mood, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Roux-en-Y is an effective means of losing weight, and as the body mass decreases with weight loss, the required dose of levothyroxine is decreased. It would not present with the abnormal neurologic findings seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRoux-en-Y bariatric surgery increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency via reduction of food intake, decreased functional parietal cell count, and reduced absorption of vitamin B12 (which may cause subacute combined degeneration).",

Iron deficiency can cause fatigue and weakness, but it is less likely to cause mood changes and brisk reflexes. The neurological symptoms (falls, brisk reflexes) are not typical of iron deficiency.\n\n(B) **Prior Treponema pallidum exposure:** This refers to syphilis, which can cause neurological symptoms in its tertiary stage (neurosyphilis). Symptoms can include mood changes and neurological deficits. However, the patient's monogamous relationship and lack of other symptoms make this less likely without further evidence.\n\n(C) **Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin:** This option suggests a mood disorder, such as depression, which aligns with the mood changes and anhedonia. However, it does not explain the falls or neurological findings (brisk reflexes, lower extremity weakness).\n\n(D) **Reduced functional parietal cell count:** This is related to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can occur after gastric bypass due to reduced intrinsic factor production.

However, the presentation is not classic for neurosyphilis, and there is no mention of syphilis history or risk factors.\n\n**(C) Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin**: \n- This could explain mood changes and sleep disturbances, as these neurotransmitters are involved in mood regulation. However, it does not directly explain the neurological symptoms like falls and brisk reflexes.\n\n**(D) Reduced functional parietal cell count**: \n- This could lead to vitamin B12 deficiency due to decreased intrinsic factor production, especially after gastric bypass surgery. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms (e.g., weakness, brisk reflexes, falls) and mood changes (e.g., depression, irritability).\n\n**(E) Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose**: \n- Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, depression, and weakness, but the patient is on levothyroxine. Subtherapeutic dosing could cause some symptoms, but it is less likely to cause brisk reflexes and falls.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe combination of mood changes, neurological symptoms (falls, weakness, brisk reflexes), and the history of gastric bypass surgery strongly suggests a nutritional deficiency, particularly vitamin B12 deficiency.

This is particularly relevant given her history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, which is known to affect nutrient absorption, including vitamin B12.\n\nVitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, which is produced by parietal cells in the stomach. After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, the stomach's capacity and function are altered, leading to a reduced number of functional parietal cells. This results in decreased intrinsic factor production and subsequently reduced vitamin B12 absorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, mood changes, and even cognitive disturbances, which align with the patient's presentation.\n\nThe other options can be ruled out based on the following reasoning:\n\n- (A) Poor iron absorption: While iron deficiency can occur after gastric bypass surgery, it typically presents with symptoms of anemia such as fatigue and pallor, rather than the neurological symptoms observed here.\n\n- (B) Prior Treponema pallidum exposure: This would suggest neurosyphilis, which is less likely given the patient's history and the specific symptoms presented.\n\n- (C) Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin: While mood changes can be related to neurotransmitter imbalances, the neurological symptoms and the specific context of gastric bypass surgery make vitamin B12 deficiency a more plausible cause.\n\n- (E) Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose: This would primarily affect thyroid function, leading to symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance, rather than the neurological symptoms observed.\n\nGiven the alignment of the patient's symptoms with vitamin B12 deficiency and the known effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on parietal cell function, the most logical cause of the patient's symptoms is:\n\n(D) Reduced functional parietal cell count\n\nFinal answer: D",

He states that he currently feels crushing pressure over his chest. He is given aspirin and an ECG is performed in triage, as seen in Figure A. His past medical history is notable for diabetes and obesity. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. His temperature is 97.9\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 155/99 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient\u2019s chest pain is worse when the ECG in the emergency department is taken, compared to the one taken in triage. He is given nitroglycerin, with minimal improvement in his symptoms.

        "answer_idx": "E",
        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a pattern of chest pain (pressure and diaphoresis) that is highly concerning for an acute myocardial infarction. This patient initially has ST depressions (in triage) followed by ST segment normalization and possibly hyperacute T waves which raises concern for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring frequent ECGs to determine if a STEMI evolves.\n\nA STEMI presents with crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among many other possible presentations. When a patient presents with symptoms concerning for a STEMI, aspirin should be administered and an ECG should be performed. Early in a myocardial infarction, ST depressions with hyperacute T waves may be present. As the infarction evolves, the T waves may become more acute and the ST segment will begin to elevate. There may be a brief period of pseudonormalization where the ST segment appears to be normal. If the patient appears better, this can be reassuring. However, ongoing chest pain in the setting of these findings raises concern for pseudonormalization of the ST segment (an ST segment that is going to continue to rise). Nitroglycerin can be administered to see if the patient can become chest pain-free, and serial ECGs should be performed to determine if a STEMI is present. If symptoms resolve and the ECG is stable, this is reassuring and medical optimization and an elective catheterization may be performed. If the ECG evolves into a STEMI, then cardiac catheterization is indicated emergently.\n\nDaga et al. discuss STEMI and its workup. They note the ECG manifestations, and the pathophysiology in addition to the appropriate workup of acute coronary syndrome. They recommend aspirin and catheterization in an acute STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an initial ECG with ST depression (blue arrows) followed by pseudonormalization of the ST segment (green arrows) and possibly hyperacute T waves (black arrows), which are concerning for ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac catheterization may be required in this patient; however, if the patient\u2019s chest pain improves or if the troponin is negative, it is unlikely he is having an acute myocardial infarction requiring immediate catheterization. Repeating the ECG will allow for triaging of the patient and will aid in determining if emergency cardiac catheterization is needed.\n\nAnswer B: Chest radiography is appropriate in the workup of chest pain as it can rule out diagnoses such as pneumothorax or may suggest diagnoses such as an aortic dissection (type A) if there is a widened mediastinum. In this patient, the ST segment changes and characteristic history make acute coronary syndrome a more likely diagnosis, and while a chest radiograph should be performed at some point, repeating the ECG is a more dire initial step in management.\n\nAnswer C: CK-MB level could be helpful in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred as it elevates rapidly and also decreases fairly rapidly. This makes it useful when diagnosing a new myocardial infarction after a recent infarction as the troponin may still be elevated from the previous infarction. This patient has no history of recent myocardial infarction, and a repeat ECG is more dire to determine if this patient needs emergent intervention. Of note, the decision for emergent catheterization should not wait on cardiac biomarkers.\n\nAnswer D: Heparin should not be given empirically to patients in chest pain. It does not necessarily decrease mortality but does increase the risk of bleeding. It is often given to patients with an NSTEMI.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPseudonormalization occurs when an ST depression begins to elevate and appears normal in the setting of a myocardial infarction, requiring close monitoring and serial ECGs to ensure that a ST elevation myocardial infarction does not occur.",

He presents with classic symptoms of ACS, including chest pressure and diaphoresis, and his condition worsens despite initial treatment with aspirin and nitroglycerin.\n\nThe key points to consider in this case are:\n\n1. **Symptoms and Risk Factors**: The patient exhibits classic symptoms of ACS, including chest pain and diaphoresis, and has significant risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, and smoking.\n\n2. **Response to Initial Treatment**: The minimal response to nitroglycerin suggests a significant coronary artery blockage, which is a common scenario in cases of myocardial infarction.\n\n3. **ECG Findings**: Although the specific ECG findings are not described, the worsening of symptoms and the context suggest that there may be changes indicative of ischemia or infarction.\n\n4. **Need for Immediate Intervention**: Given the high suspicion of a significant coronary artery occlusion and the patient's worsening condition, immediate intervention is necessary to prevent further myocardial damage.\n\n5. **Consensus Among Experts**: All three medical experts agree that cardiac catheterization is the most appropriate next step. This procedure allows for direct visualization of the coronary arteries and the opportunity for immediate intervention, such as angioplasty or stenting, if a blockage is found.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most appropriate next step in management is to proceed with cardiac catheterization. This aligns with the consensus among the medical experts and addresses the urgent need to evaluate and potentially treat the suspected coronary artery blockage.\n\nFinal Answer: **A** (Cardiac catheterization)",

He states that ever since his wife died 4 months ago, he has been eating and sleeping more and no longer engages in any activities he once enjoyed such as hiking or fishing. He feels guilty for not spending more time with his wife before she died. He was recently fired for making several major bookkeeping mistakes at work as an accountant as he had trouble focusing. The patient is requesting oxycodone at this appointment as he states he has burning pain in his legs that feels worse now than it has in years past. The patient has a past medical history of obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease.

In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are often a better initial drug in depression than SSRIs in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSansone and Sansone discuss SNRIs and their uses. They discuss how there are different efficacies and propensities of the different SNRIs. They recommend choosing an appropriate SNRI based on the patient's needs and comorbidities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression in patients who also suffer from other neuropathic pain conditions or conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred. A TCA might be appropriate if the patient had already failed other first-line agents.\n\nAnswer B: Bupropion is a weight-neutral antidepressant that can be used in smoking cessation and patients who are trying to avoid the sexual side effects of SSRIs (anorgasmia). It would not address this patient's diabetic neuropathy, though it could be beneficial for his obesity.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is an SSRI that could be used first-line for major depressive disorder. However, if a patient has a concomitant condition, it is better to choose a single agent that addresses both problems; thus, SNRIs are better first-line medications in this patient with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer D: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that can be used in atypical depression or as a third-line or later agent in the management of depression. This agent can cause a hypertensive crisis in the setting of tyramine consumption, has many medication interactions, and a long washout period. Thus, it is not usually a first or second-line agent. However, it is highly effective in patients who have failed other first-line agents and should still be used in appropriate candidates.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSNRIs are appropriate first-line agents for major depressive disorder in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).",

The key points from the scenario are:\n\n1. **Altered Mental Status and Confusion**: The patient became confused during a marathon, suggesting a possible heat-related illness or electrolyte imbalance.\n\n2. **High Temperature**: The patient has a temperature of 105\u00b0F (40.6\u00b0C), indicating hyperthermia, which is consistent with heat stroke.\n\n3. **Seizure Disorder**: The patient has a history of seizures and experienced a tonic-clonic seizure during the examination.\n\n4. **Urine Dipstick Positive for Red Blood Cells**: This suggests possible rhabdomyolysis, which can occur due to muscle breakdown from extreme physical exertion and heat exposure.\n\n5. **Vital Signs**: Elevated pulse and respirations are consistent with the body's response to hyperthermia and stress.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely condition affecting the patient is exertional heat stroke, potentially complicated by rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream, including potassium, phosphate, uric acid, and myoglobin, which can cause acute kidney injury.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **(A) Hyperkalemia**: Rhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia due to the release of potassium from damaged muscle cells.\n\n- **(B) Hyperphosphatemia**: Phosphate can also be released from muscle cells during rhabdomyolysis, leading to hyperphosphatemia.\n\n- **(C) Hyperuricemia**: Uric acid levels can increase due to cell breakdown and dehydration, but this is less directly related to rhabdomyolysis compared to potassium and phosphate.\n\n- **(D) Hypocalcemia**: Calcium levels can decrease in rhabdomyolysis due to binding with released phosphate, leading to hypocalcemia.\n\n- **(E) Hyponatremia**: While hyponatremia can occur in endurance athletes due to excessive water intake, the presence of rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia makes electrolyte imbalances related to muscle breakdown more likely.\n\nConsidering the clinical context and the typical laboratory findings associated with rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia is a common and significant finding due to the release of potassium from damaged muscle cells.\n\n**Answer: (A) Hyperkalemia**",

The patient is a young man who developed altered mental status and a seizure during a marathon. His vital signs indicate hyperthermia (high temperature), tachycardia (high pulse rate), and tachypnea (high respiratory rate). The urine dipstick is positive for red blood cells, suggesting possible muscle breakdown or hemolysis.\n\nA. **Clinical Presentation Analysis:**\n   - **Hyperthermia:** The elevated temperature suggests heat-related illness, possibly heat stroke, which can occur during intense physical activity like a marathon.\n   - **Seizure Disorder:** The history of seizures and the occurrence of a tonic-clonic seizure during the exam could be exacerbated by electrolyte imbalances or heat stroke.\n   - **Urine Dipstick Positive for RBCs:** This finding is indicative of rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle breakdown releases myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can damage the kidneys and cause myoglobinuria (presence of myoglobin in urine).\n\nB. **Pathophysiology Considerations:**\n   - **Rhabdomyolysis:** This condition can result from extreme physical exertion, especially in hot conditions, leading to muscle breakdown. It is characterized by:\n     - **Hyperkalemia:** Due to the release of intracellular potassium from damaged muscle cells.\n     - **Hyperphosphatemia:** Due to the release of intracellular phosphate.\n     - **Hyperuricemia:** Due to increased purine metabolism from muscle breakdown.\n     - **Hypocalcemia:** Calcium binds to damaged muscle tissue, reducing serum calcium levels.\n     - **Hyponatremia:** Can occur due to excessive sweating and fluid loss, but less directly related to rhabdomyolysis.\n\nC. **Most Likely Laboratory Finding:**\n   - Given the scenario of rhabdomyolysis, the most characteristic laboratory finding is **hyperkalemia**. This is due to the release of potassium from damaged muscle cells into the bloodstream. While other electrolyte disturbances can occur, hyperkalemia is a direct consequence of muscle cell lysis and is a critical finding in rhabdomyolysis.\n\nD. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the clinical presentation and the pathophysiology of rhabdomyolysis, the most likely laboratory finding in this patient is **hyperkalemia**.\n\n**Answer: (A) Hyperkalemia**",

A common paraneoplastic syndrome in small cell lung cancer is Lambert-Eaton syndrome which presents with muscle weakness that improves with activity and worsens with rest. Activity improves symptoms due to accumulation of calcium with exercise which allows for acetylcholine release. This occurs secondary to antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels which decrease acetylcholine release. The diagnosis of Lambert Eaton syndrome can be confirmed with electromyography. Treatment includes addressing the underlying lung tumor.\n\nKesner et al. review the diagnosis and etiology of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. They discuss how this disease is associated with lung cancer.

A glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells.\n\nA glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells of the pancreas. This tumor pathologically secretes glucagon leading to profound hyperglycemia that is refractory to the normal treatments for diabetes. Patients also present with a classic rash termed necrolytic migratory erythema which presents with painful, erythematous papules and plaques. Other findings include gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hematologic findings include a normocytic, normochromic anemia. The diagnosis can be supported with a glucagon level, which will be elevated. Imaging of the pancreas by CT or MRI (more accurate) can further support the diagnosis.\n\nZandee et al. review glucagonoma. They note the presentation and symptoms associated with a glucagonoma, including the classic rash and elevated blood glucose. They recommend considering this diagnosis in patients who present with rash and hyperglycemia refractory to typical treatments.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Beta-cell destruction is the pathophysiology of type I diabetes mellitus which presents with polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, and hyperglycemia (typically in a pediatric patient). It can progress to diabetic ketoacidosis which presents with hyperglycemia, an anion gap acidosis, altered mental status, and Kussmaul respirations.\n\nAnswer C: Beta-cell tumor describes an insulinoma, which would present with hypoglycemia refractory to glucose administration. This condition is caused by increased release of insulin. The diagnosis should be suspected in the setting of hypoglycemia, an elevated insulin level, and an elevated C-peptide level. Imaging of the abdomen/pancreas with an MRI will reveal the insulin-secreting mass.\n\nAnswer D: Hypercortisolism can cause Cushing syndrome which presents with hyperglycemia, obesity, striae, limb/muscle atrophy, mood changes, and hypertension. A buffalo hump and moon faces may also be seen. This condition can either be from endogenous ACTH production or cortisol production or can be from exogenous steroid use.\n\nAnswer E: Insulin resistance is the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and presents with obesity, hyperglycemia, and an elevated hemoglobin A1c. The mainstay of management is weight loss, though medications such as metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin are often needed.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA glucagonoma is a tumor of the alpha cells of the pancreas that hypersecretes glucagon.",

Patient Presentation and History:**\n- The patient is a 27-year-old woman with altered mental status, a history of bipolar disorder treated with lithium, and chronic lower back pain.\n- She was found next to a suicide note, suggesting a possible overdose or intentional ingestion of medication.\n- Her vital signs show tachycardia (pulse of 127/min), mild fever (temperature of 100.5\u00b0F), and normal oxygen saturation.\n\n**B. Lithium Toxicity Consideration:**\n- Given her history of bipolar disorder and lithium use, lithium toxicity is a strong possibility, especially in the context of a suicide attempt.\n- Symptoms of lithium toxicity can include altered mental status, tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and in severe cases, cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n**C. ECG Findings:**\n- While the ECG is not provided here, common ECG changes in lithium toxicity include T-wave flattening or inversion, QT prolongation, and bradycardia. However, the question does not specify the ECG findings, so we focus on the clinical presentation.\n\n**D. Analysis of Options:**\n1. **Diaphoresis (A):** Sweating is not typically associated with lithium toxicity. It is more common in sympathomimetic or cholinergic crises.\n2. **Jaundice (B):** Jaundice is not a typical feature of lithium toxicity. It is more related to liver dysfunction.\n3. **Miosis (C):** Pupil constriction is not associated with lithium toxicity. It is more common in opioid overdose or cholinergic crisis.\n4. **Urinary Retention (D):** Lithium toxicity does not typically cause urinary retention. It is more associated with anticholinergic effects.\n5. **Wheezing (E):** Wheezing is not a typical feature of lithium toxicity. It is more related to respiratory conditions or allergic reactions.\n\n**E. Likely Findings in Lithium Toxicity:**\n- While none of the options directly match common symptoms of lithium toxicity, altered mental status and tachycardia are consistent with the presentation.\n- Diaphoresis (A) could occur in the context of autonomic instability or other drug interactions, but it is not a classic symptom of lithium toxicity.\n\n**F.

On arrival, the patient has slurred speech and is somnolent. Further is unable to be elicited. His temperature is 98.0\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min with a saturation of 97% on room air.

            "E": "Observation"
        },
        "answer_idx": "E",
        "reason": "This patient's presentation with altered mental status, pinpoint pupils, and decreased bowel sounds is most consistent with an opioid overdose. Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial. The authors found that patients who received intranasal naloxone needed a second dose of naloxone more frequently compared to patients who received intramuscular naloxone. The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration). This patient is oxygenating well, protecting his airway, and does not have profound bradypnea.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOpioid overdose presents with somnolence, pinpoint pupils, decreased bowel sounds, and bradypnea; stable patients who are adequately breathing and protecting their airway require only observation until clinically sober.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with pain upon defecation, constipation, and a fissure lateral to the midline which is suggestive of an anal fissure. Anal fissures lateral to the midline are associated with inflammatory and infectious etiologies; thus, further workup (testing for HIV, fecal occult blood testing, and sexually transmitted disease testing) is needed rather than merely symptomatic treatment.\n\nAnal fissures present with exquisite pain upon defecation which may lead to fecal retention and constipation. Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient\u2019s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures. They note that while both operative and non-operative interventions may be indicated in the management of an anal fissure after alternative diagnoses have been ruled out, advances in medical management may spare patients sphincter-dividing surgery. They recommend considering all modalities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis followed by an MRI may be the most appropriate testing if a perirectal abscess is suspected. These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation. It would be inappropriate to only treat this patient symptomatically with a lateral anal fissure as this is a sign of a more serious diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnal fissures that are lateral to the midline require workup for sexually transmitted infections, cancer, and autoimmune disease.",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

Patient History and Current Presentation:**\n- The patient is a 31-year-old male with HIV, initially presenting with a right upper lobe lung infiltrate, a very low CD4 count (40/mm^3), and a high HIV viral load (115,000 copies/mL).\n- He was treated appropriately, likely with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and possibly antimicrobials for opportunistic infections.\n- After 4 weeks of treatment, his CD4 count improved significantly to over 400/mm^3, and his HIV viral load became negligible, indicating effective ART.\n- He now presents with fever, malaise, cough, hemoptysis, and new nodules in the left upper lobe with hilar adenopathy.\n\n**B. Differential Diagnosis:**\n- The rapid improvement in CD4 count suggests immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), where the recovering immune system mounts an inflammatory response to existing infections.\n- The new nodules and hilar adenopathy could indicate a reactivation or worsening of a previous infection, such as tuberculosis (TB), especially given the history of lung infiltrate and the patient's immunocompromised state.\n\n**C. Management Considerations:**\n- Continuing ART is crucial for maintaining immune recovery.\n- Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment is not advisable without clear evidence of resolution of infection.\n- Determining drug sensitivities could be useful if there is suspicion of resistant infection, but it is not the immediate next step.\n- Obtaining a D-dimer level is not relevant to the current presentation, which is more suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process rather than a thromboembolic event.\n- Starting high-dose glucocorticoids and discontinuing ART could be considered in severe IRIS cases, but discontinuing ART is generally not recommended due to the risk of HIV progression.\n\n**D. Most Appropriate Next Step:**\nGiven the presentation and the likelihood of IRIS, the most appropriate next step is to manage the inflammatory response while continuing ART. High-dose glucocorticoids can be used to control severe IRIS symptoms, but ART should not be discontinued.\n\n**Answer:**\n(E) Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy\n\nNote: While option E suggests discontinuing ART, in practice, ART is usually continued alongside glucocorticoid treatment for IRIS. The question may imply a severe IRIS scenario where temporary ART discontinuation is considered, but this is not standard practice.",

If the patient is experiencing IRIS, continuing ART is crucial, but additional management might be needed.\n\n(B) **Determine drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection**: This could be useful if there is suspicion of drug-resistant infection, but it doesn't address the immediate management of the current symptoms.\n\n(C) **Discontinue antimicrobial treatment**: This is not advisable without clear evidence of resolution of infection or adverse effects from the antimicrobials.\n\n(D) **Obtain a D-dimer level**: This is typically used to assess for thromboembolic events, which is not the primary concern here given the presentation.\n\n(E) **Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy**: High-dose glucocorticoids can be used to manage severe IRIS, but discontinuing ART is generally not recommended as it can lead to worsening of HIV control.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the scenario, the patient is likely experiencing IRIS due to the rapid improvement in immune function after ART initiation, leading to an inflammatory response against a latent infection (possibly tuberculosis, given the lung findings and history). The appropriate management of IRIS often includes continuing ART and adding glucocorticoids to manage the inflammatory response.\n\n**Answer:**\n(E) Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy"

Symptoms include livedo reticularis, gastrointestinal problems such as mesenteric ischemia or pancreatitis, and acute kidney injury. Patients who have undergone cardiac catheterization should be monitored for the development of this complication. Treatment is centered around treating the current complications, often using supportive therapy as they self-resolve. In addition, patients should be treated carefully to prevent recurrent embolism.\n\nManingding and Kermani review the evidence regarding the presentation of vasculitis mimics. They discuss how cholesterol embolism can cause diverse systemic symptoms and livedo reticularis. They recommend carefully considering the history of each patient.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating a netlike reticular bluish discoloration of the skin (red circle). These findings are consistent with livedo reticularis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Heart failure and reinfarction could present with renal failure but would likely present with other symptoms of heart failure as well (pulmonary crackles, edema, and jugular venous distension). Treatment of a repeat infarct involves catheterization and fluid overload involves volume optimization.\n\nAnswer C: Medication side effects could explain this patient's livedo reticularis, but the drugs that may cause this (certain antivirals and amantadine) would not have been given to this patient. These medications also typically do not cause abdominal pain.\n\nAnswer D: Pancreatitis presents with abdominal pain and an elevated lipase; however, it is not the underlying pathology for this patient's presentation but rather is a complication of the cholesterol embolism.

        "final_raw_response": "Based on the information provided and the insights from the medical experts, the most likely underlying diagnosis for this patient is cholesterol embolism (Option A).\n\nHere's the detailed rationale:\n\n1. **Recent Myocardial Infarction (MI):** The patient had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF), which was treated appropriately. Post-MI, especially after interventions like cardiac catheterization, there is a risk of cholesterol embolism due to dislodgement of atherosclerotic plaques.\n\n2. **Abdominal Pain and Elevated Lipase:** While elevated lipase can suggest pancreatitis, the broader context of recent MI and systemic symptoms makes cholesterol embolism more plausible. Cholesterol emboli can affect the pancreas, leading to elevated lipase levels without classic pancreatitis.\n\n3. **Renal Impairment:** The increase in creatinine (1.6 mg/dL) suggests renal impairment. Cholesterol embolism can cause renal damage due to emboli lodging in renal vasculature, leading to acute kidney injury.\n\n4. **Skin Findings:** The mention of a notable finding in Figure A, although not visible here, likely refers to characteristic skin changes such as livedo reticularis or blue toe syndrome, which are associated with cholesterol embolism.\n\n5. **Systemic Process:** The combination of multi-organ involvement (abdominal pain, renal impairment, potential skin findings) aligns with a systemic process like cholesterol embolism rather than isolated conditions like pancreatitis or medication side effects.\n\n6. **Exclusion of Other Options:**\n   - **Heart failure and reinfarction (B):** While possible, these do not explain the elevated lipase or specific skin findings.\n   - **Medication side effect (C):** Unlikely to cause the combination of symptoms observed.\n   - **Pancreatitis (D):** Does not account for renal impairment and potential skin findings.\n   - **Renal failure (E):** While present, it is a consequence rather than the primary diagnosis.\n\nGiven the systemic nature of the symptoms and the context of recent cardiac intervention, cholesterol embolism is the most comprehensive diagnosis that explains the patient's presentation.\n\nFinal Answer: **A** (Cholesterol embolism)",

Linear IgG binding of anti-hemidesmosome antibodies along the basement membrane is the underlying cause of this disease.\n\nBullous pemphigoid presents with a urticarial prodrome in elderly patients followed by the formation of tense bullae that do not break when pressure is applied to them. IgG antibodies bind the hemidesmosome along the basement membrane and appear linear on immunofluorescence. Risk factors that are associated with this condition include the initiation of new medications such as loop diuretics, metformin, and neuroleptics. Steroids are the treatment of choice.\n\nMiyamoto et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of bullous pemphigoid.

Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data. Therefore, the pathophysiology of West syndrome is more likely CRH-excess mediated rather than due to a deficiency of vitamin B6.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWest syndrome, which may be caused by CRH excess, presents with hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression, and infantile spasms.",

Given the blurry vision and ataxia in the setting of increased blasts, this patient may be suffering from a hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to a blast crisis, which can be seen in CML.\n\nCML is a neoplastic proliferation of myeloid stem cells. Patients are often asymptomatic and may present with a white blood cell count > 50,000/mm^3. There are many different presentations. The chronic phase presents with < 10% blasts and is often asymptomatic. The accelerated phase has increased blasts, and patients present with fatigue, weight loss, malaise, night sweats, abdominal pain, and hepatosplenomegaly. Finally, the blast phase presents similar to the accelerated phase but with more severe symptoms. The blast phase may evolve into a blast crisis (> 20% blasts) which could cause a hyperviscosity syndrome. Hypervicosity syndrome may require IV fluids and leukapheresis. The most common translocation in CML is the 9;22 translocation which forms the BCR:ABL gene product.\n\nJain et al. review CML. They note the outcomes in patients in the blast phase in CML and how there are more poor outcomes associated with this phase. They recommend paying close attention and obtaining a CBC with a differential to determine the percent blasts.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is more common in pediatric patients and presents with pancytopenia, fatigue, recurrent infections (from leukopenia), and bleeding (from thrombocytopenia). Other findings include systemic symptoms, malaise, fever, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly.\n\nAnswer B: Acute myelogenous leukemia is a malignancy of myeloblasts and presents in the elderly. Patients will present with fatigue, malaise, weight loss, anorexia, fever, leukocytosis, anemia (causing fatigue), thrombocytopenia (causing bleeding), and neutropenia (leading to life-threatening infections). Auer rods can be seen on peripheral smear.\n\nAnswer C: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a monoclonal proliferation of incompetent mature B cells that occurs in elderly men and is the most common form of leukemia in the west. Patients are often asymptomatic and may have a white blood cell count > 50,000/mm^3. When symptomatic, patients may experience chills, weight loss, and weakness (note these symptoms are nonspecific). Peripheral smear will show smudge cells.\n\nAnswer E: Multiple myeloma is common in the elderly and presents with CRAB: hyperCalcemia, Renal insufficiency, Anemia, and lytic Bone lesions/Back pain.

The presence of blasts, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and the patient's age strongly suggest AML.\n   - **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL):** Usually presents with lymphocytosis rather than blasts. The age fits, but the laboratory findings do not.\n   - **Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML):** Characterized by a high leukocyte count but typically with mature cells rather than blasts. The presence of blasts suggests a blast crisis, but the percentage of blasts is more consistent with acute leukemia.\n   - **Multiple Myeloma:** Typically presents with anemia, renal dysfunction, hypercalcemia, and bone pain. The presence of blasts is not characteristic of multiple myeloma.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The combination of high leukocyte count with 35% blasts, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and the patient's age strongly supports the diagnosis of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). The symptoms and laboratory findings align well with AML, making it the most likely diagnosis.\n\n**Updated Answer:**\n\n(B) Acute myelogenous leukemia"

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with constant right upper quadrant pain in the setting of oral contraceptives (OCP) and likely anabolic steroid use, suggesting a diagnosis of a ruptured hepatic adenoma (HA). The pathophysiology of HA is vascular ectasia from exposure to OCPs and androgens.\n\nA hepatic adenoma typically occurs secondary to exposure to OCPs and androgens (anabolic steroids) causing a generalized vascular ectasia. Both of these drugs should be discontinued in patients with hepatic adenoma. Symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Sudden worsening of pain with unstable vitals suggests a ruptured hepatic adenoma. Patients should be managed with fluids and an ultrasound should be performed to support the diagnosis. Additional imaging tests include an abdominal contrast-enhanced CT to better characterize the pathologic anatomy in this disease. The definitive treatment in this disease is surgery in order to remove the hepatic adenoma. In cases of a ruptured hepatic adenomas, patients require transfusion and operative management.\n\nBioulac-Sage et al. present the current data that are available for classifying hepatic adenomas. They discuss how many of these lesions involve alterations of the HNF1A gene, the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and the CTNNB1 gene. They recommend performing molecular analysis in order to better understand which lesions are likely to undergo malignant transformation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ectopic implantation of a blastocyst (ectopic pregnancy) that has ruptured could present similarly to what this patient is experiencing. Symptoms would include lower abdominal pain and unstable vitals. However, this patient's pain is more pronounced in the right upper quadrant and is occurring in the setting of OCP and possible anabolic steroid use.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation of the pancreas represents a diagnosis of pancreatitis. This would present with epigastric pain after a fatty meal or alcohol consumption. Though this patient does drink more than recommended and should be counseled to reduce her consumption, the pain began after exercising at the gym and there are no other symptoms of pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer C: Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein causes Budd-Chiari syndrome, which presents with a non-specific triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly in the setting of a hypercoagulable state (factor V Leiden, polycythemia vera, OCP use, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). Though this patient has risk factors for this pathology, they do not have any classic symptoms.\n\nAnswer D: Obstruction of the common bile duct with radio-opaque stones would present with colicky right upper quadrant pain in a patient that is \"fat, female, fertile, and forty.\" Though the pain presented in this case is localized to the right upper quadrant, it is not colicky and there is not a positive Murphy sign described. OCP's are a risk factor for cholesterol stones as are rapid weight loss, both of which this patient has. This is a strong possibility on the differential; however, the symptoms presented suggest a diagnosis of ruptured hepatic adenoma given the demographics of the patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA hepatic adenoma presents with right upper quadrant pain in the setting of OCP and/or androgen use and can rupture leading to unstable vitals.",

The RUQ pain and the patient's presentation are not classic for an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n(B) **Inflammation of the pancreas (Pancreatitis)**: Often presents with epigastric pain that radiates to the back, nausea, and vomiting. The RUQ tenderness is not typical, and the patient's history does not strongly suggest pancreatitis.\n\n(C) **Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein (Budd-Chiari syndrome)**: This condition can cause RUQ pain, hepatomegaly, ascites, and liver dysfunction. The sudden onset of severe pain and the patient's hypotension could be consistent with this diagnosis, especially if there is an underlying hypercoagulable state, possibly exacerbated by oral contraceptive use.\n\n(D) **Obstruction of the common bile duct by radio-opaque stones (Gallstones)**: Typically causes RUQ pain, possibly with jaundice and fever (cholangitis). The sudden worsening of pain could fit, but the hypotension and tachycardia are more severe than usually seen with uncomplicated gallstones.\n\n(E) **Vascular ectasia within the liver**: This is less common and typically does not present with acute severe pain or the hemodynamic instability seen in this patient.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of RUQ pain, hypotension, and tachycardia, along with the patient's use of oral contraceptives, suggests a vascular issue in the liver.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after trauma to his finger with a subungual hematoma. Given that he has no other associated injuries, trephination is the only management indicated.\n\nA subungual hematoma occurs after trauma to the finger leading to a collection of blood under the fingernail. Depending on the mechanism, this can be associated with a distal phalanx fracture. Evaluation for a fracture should include a thorough history, exam, and radiography. If there are no other signs of injury including nailbed dislocation or an open fracture, then management requires only trephination (putting a hole in the nail to allow blood to drain) as this alleviates pressure on the nailbed matrix thus preventing possible irreversible damage.\n\nRsoer et al. compare nail bed repair to nail trephination for subungual hematomas in children. The authors find that there was no difference in complications or outcomes between nail bed repair and trephination; however, the cost in the nail trephination group was lower. The authors recommend nail trephination for children with a subungual hematoma and an intact nail and nail margin.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows the physical exam finding of a subungual hematoma with a collection of blood underneath the fingernail bed (green circle).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Excision and histological examination could be appropriate management of melanoma, which may present under the fingernails with a hyperpigmented, irregular skin lesion, or a \u201cbarcode\u201d appearance if it is at the base of the nail. A spontaneous subungual hematoma could be suggestive of melanoma; however, in the setting of trauma, it is a much less likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer B: Fingernail removal should only be performed if there is also nail avulsion or nail fold disruption to allow for inspection of the nail bed and repair of any laceration. Failure to repair a nailbed laceration could lead to permanent deformity of the fingernail when it regrows.\n\nAnswer C: Observation is inappropriate as the accumulation of blood under the nail in a subungual hematoma could lead to ischemia and permanent injury to the nailbed. When a subungual hematoma is present, trephination is indicated.\n\nAnswer D: Operative repair may be necessary for fractures; however, this patient has no fracture and only has a subungual hematoma which can be drained easily.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA subungual hematoma is common after trauma, presents with a collection of blood under the fingernail, and should be treated with trephination.",

                "To analyze the question and determine the most appropriate management for the patient, let's break down the information provided and evaluate each option step-by-step.\n\n**A. Patient Presentation and Examination:**\n- The patient is a 33-year-old man who slammed his finger in a car door 5 hours ago.\n- Pain is well controlled with acetaminophen, indicating that the injury is not causing severe pain at this time.\n- Vital signs are stable: temperature is normal, blood pressure is within normal range, pulse is slightly elevated but not concerning, respirations are low but not critically so, and oxygen saturation is normal.\n- The physical exam is notable for a finding in Figure A, which is not provided here, but we can infer it likely shows a subungual hematoma (blood under the fingernail) based on the context.\n- Radiograph shows a smooth cortex without disruption of the bone, indicating no fracture.\n\n**B. Analysis of Options:**\n1. **Excision and histological examination (A):** This option is typically used for suspicious lesions or growths that require biopsy. It is not appropriate for a traumatic injury like a subungual hematoma.\n\n2. **Fingernail removal (B):** This is a more invasive procedure usually reserved for severe nail bed injuries or when the nail is significantly damaged. Given the controlled pain and lack of fracture, this is likely unnecessary.\n\n3. **Observation (C):** This involves monitoring the injury without intervention. While it is a conservative approach, it may not address the discomfort or potential complications of a subungual hematoma.\n\n4. **Operative repair (D):** This is used for complex injuries requiring surgical intervention. The absence of a fracture and controlled pain suggest this is not needed.\n\n5. **Trephination (E):** This procedure involves creating a small hole in the nail to relieve pressure from a subungual hematoma. It is a common and effective treatment for this condition, especially when pain is present or the hematoma is large.\n\n**C. Conclusion:**\nGiven the context of the injury (finger slammed in a car door), the controlled pain, and the radiograph findings, the most likely scenario is a subungual hematoma.

While possible, the timing of the rash appearing specifically after sexual intercourse suggests a more direct cause related to the act itself or the treatment she received.\n\n2. **Drug reaction (B):**\n   - The patient was given antibiotics, which can sometimes cause allergic reactions or drug-induced rashes. The timing of the rash appearing after starting antibiotics is consistent with a drug reaction. This is a plausible cause, especially if the rash is a known side effect of the specific antibiotic prescribed.\n\n3. **Infection (C):**\n   - While infections can cause rashes, the fact that the rash appears specifically after sexual intercourse and shortly after starting antibiotics makes an infection less likely as the direct cause of the rash.

Patient Background and Symptoms:**\n- The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of asthma, IV drug abuse, and depression.\n- She has engaged in unprotected intercourse with multiple partners and presents with abnormal vaginal discharge, suggesting a possible sexually transmitted infection (STI).\n- She was given antibiotics and advised on safe sex practices.\n- She presents to the emergency department with a rash that appears after sexual intercourse.\n- Vital signs are relatively normal, with a slight fever (99.5\u00b0F).\n\n**B. Analysis of Symptoms:**\n- The rash appears after sexual intercourse, which suggests a possible allergic or hypersensitivity reaction.\n- The timing of the rash (emerging after sex) is crucial in determining the cause.\n- The patient was recently given antibiotics, which could be relevant to the rash.\n\n**C. Evaluation of Options:**\n1. **Antigen exposure (A):** This could refer to an allergic reaction to something encountered during sexual intercourse, such as latex in condoms or a partner's bodily fluids. However, the rash is described as emerging every time she has sex, which might not align with antigen exposure unless consistently exposed to the same antigen.\n\n2. **Drug reaction (B):** The patient was recently prescribed antibiotics. Drug reactions, including allergic reactions to antibiotics, are common and can cause rashes. The timing of the rash after starting antibiotics is consistent with a drug reaction.\n\n3. **Infection (C):** While infections can cause rashes, the immediate emergence of a rash after sexual intercourse is less typical for infections. Infections usually have a longer incubation period before symptoms like rashes appear.\n\n4. **IV drug use (D):** While IV drug use can lead to various complications, the specific symptom of a rash emerging after sex does not directly correlate with IV drug use.\n\n5. **Photosensitivity (E):** Photosensitivity reactions are typically related to exposure to sunlight or UV light, not sexual intercourse. This option is less likely given the context.\n\n**D. Conclusion:**\nGiven the information, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a drug reaction, specifically to the antibiotics she was prescribed. The timing of the rash appearing after starting the medication aligns with a common presentation of drug-induced rashes.\n\n**Answer:**\n(B) Drug reaction"

        "reason": "This medical student has sustained a hollow-bore needlestick injury. The most appropriate next step is to repeat HIV serology and immediately initiate triple antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir.\n\nHealthcare exposures to HIV are divided into 2 categories based on the level of contact with the source patient. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions, immediate prophylaxis is recommended. This category also includes all needlestick exposures. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s urine, feces, or bodily secretions, prophylaxis is not recommended. If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects. Prophylactic treatment should be initiated immediately (ideally within 1-2 hours) and continued for 4 weeks at which time the healthcare worker\u2019s serology should be repeated.\n\nParikh et al. studied technologies for monitoring HIV infection. They discuss how high throughput methods are required in order to surveil for infection on a population level. They recommend using next-generation sequencing methods to improve surveillance methods.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Immediately initiating triple antiretroviral therapy is appropriate after drawing the medical student\u2019s HIV serology. The patient\u2019s serology at the time of exposure must be established to compare to future testing. Despite her previous negative serology and low-risk lifestyle, it would still be best to repeat the testing at the same time prophylactic treatment is initiated.\n\nAnswer B: Perform genotype testing on source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to results is incorrect because this option would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Empiric treatment with a triple antiretroviral drug combination is appropriate for all patients with high-risk exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Waiting to hear that the medical student\u2019s HIV serology is negative would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Triple antiretroviral drug treatment should be initiated without waiting for the results. Empiric treatment of all patients with high-risk exposure is recommended in all cases.\n\nAnswer D: Waiting for the results of the medical student\u2019s serology would delay treatment for her exposure. If her serology is already positive, she will need to be treated past the 4-week period of prophylaxis. Even though she does not engage in high-risk behaviors, a positive serology would demonstrate that she was already infected with HIV.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAfter a needlestick injury from a HIV-positive source patient, a healthcare worker\u2019s HIV serology should be drawn and they should be immediately initiated on triple antiretroviral drug therapy.",

This type of exposure is considered high-risk for potential HIV transmission, especially given the high viral load of the source patient (1,800,000 copies/mL).\n\n2. **Source Patient's Status:** The source patient has a CD4 count of 550 cells/\u00b5L, indicating relatively preserved immune function, but a very high viral load, which increases the risk of transmission. The patient has only recently started HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) 3 days ago, which means the viral load is likely still high.\n\n3. **Medical Student's Background:** The student has a negative HIV serology from 2 years ago, is monogamous, and denies intravenous drug use, suggesting low risk of prior HIV exposure.\n\nB. **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Guidelines:**\n\n1. **PEP Initiation:** Current guidelines recommend initiating post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible after a high-risk exposure to HIV, ideally within hours. The effectiveness of PEP decreases significantly if started more than 72 hours after exposure.\n\n2. **PEP Regimen:** Typically, PEP involves a combination of three antiretroviral drugs for a duration of 28 days.\n\nC. **Analysis of Options:**\n\n1. **Option (A): Immediately initiate triple antiretroviral therapy:** This option aligns with PEP guidelines, which recommend starting treatment immediately after exposure to reduce the risk of seroconversion.\n\n2. **Option (B): Perform genotype testing on source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to results:** This option is not practical for immediate management. Genotype testing takes time, and delaying PEP initiation is not advisable.\n\n3. **Option (C): Repeat HIV serology and initiate triple antiretroviral therapy if negative:** This option is not appropriate because waiting for serology results delays the initiation of PEP, which should be started immediately.\n\n4. **Option (D): Repeat HIV serology and initiate triple antiretroviral therapy if positive:** This option is incorrect because it suggests waiting for seroconversion, which is contrary to PEP guidelines.\n\n5. **Option (E): Repeat HIV serology and initiate triple antiretroviral therapy immediately:** While this option suggests immediate initiation of therapy, the mention of repeating serology is unnecessary at this stage.

Emergency laparoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy, due to implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube, can be life-threatening if it ruptures leading to intra-abdominal hemorrhage and shock. Initial laboratory studies should include a complete blood count and a pregnancy test. A patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability should be ascertained immediately as it determines the most appropriate next step in management. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable (hypotensive and tachycardic), a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam should be immediately performed to evaluate for intraperitoneal bleeding, and ob/gyn should be immediately consulted for emergent surgical intervention (e.g., salpingectomy or salpingotomy).

Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori.

He experiences nausea but no regurgitation or nighttime cough.\n- **Dietary Changes**: Eating smaller, more frequent meals improves his pain.\n- **Medication**: Ibuprofen seems to help, suggesting the pain might be related to inflammation or irritation.\n- **Weight Gain**: He has gained 4 pounds, indicating no significant malabsorption or severe illness.\n- **Stool Test**: Positive stool guaiac test indicates the presence of blood in the stool.\n- **Lifestyle**: Drinks alcohol on weekends and has a significant smoking history.\n- **Physical Exam**: Tenderness above the umbilicus, positive bowel sounds.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis:\nThe symptoms and findings suggest a gastrointestinal issue, possibly related to the stomach or upper small intestine. The positive stool guaiac test indicates bleeding, which could be due to an ulcer or other mucosal defect.\n\n### Options Analysis:\n- **(A) Crypt abscesses in the large intestine**: Typically associated with ulcerative colitis, which doesn't match the symptom profile (e.g., no diarrhea or lower abdominal pain).\n- **(B) Mucosal defect in the stomach**: Suggestive of a peptic ulcer, which aligns with the epigastric pain, positive stool guaiac test, and relief with ibuprofen (NSAIDs can exacerbate ulcers but also provide temporary relief).\n- **(C) Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine**: Indicative of Crohn's disease, but the presentation lacks typical symptoms like diarrhea, weight loss, or lower abdominal pain.\n- **(D) PAS-positive material in the small intestine**: Suggestive of Whipple's disease, which is rare and presents with more systemic symptoms.\n- **(E) Urease-producing organism in the small intestine**: Refers to Helicobacter pylori, commonly associated with peptic ulcers and gastritis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe patient's symptoms, positive stool guaiac test, and relief with ibuprofen strongly suggest a peptic ulcer. The endoscopy with biopsy is likely to reveal either a mucosal defect or the presence of Helicobacter pylori, which is a urease-producing organism.

Anti-ribonucleoprotein (U1) antibodies are found in this disease.\n\nMixed connective tissue disease can present with a vast array of symptoms. The most common symptoms are Raynaud phenomenon (vascular hyper-reactivity that presents with burning/pain in the hands where the hands change color from white to blue to red, seen in Figure A), arthralgias, myalgias, dysphagia, and edema of the hands. Anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein antibodies are commonly found in mixed connective tissue disease and are a specific marker. In this disease, there is typically an absence of renal involvement. Treatment involves steroids as well as calcium channel blockers for symptomatic control of Raynaud phenomenon.\n\nBatu et al. review the evidence regarding patients with mixed connective tissue disease. They found that many patients have overlapping symptoms with systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. They recommend studying patients with these mixed characteristics in order to better understand which treatment modalities are effective.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing the blanching of the distal fingers (red box). This finding demonstrates the Raynaud phenomenon during the early phase where the vessels have spasmed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anti-dsDNA is a specific marker in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE presents with SOAP BRAIN MD - Serositis, Oral ulcers, Arthritis, Photosensitivity, Blood disorders (hemolytic anemia, etc.), Renal involvement, ANA, Immune phenomena (anti-dsDNA, Smith), Neurological symptoms, Malar rash, and Discoid rash. Four of these criteria must be met to suspect a diagnosis of SLE. Treatment is with hydroxychloroquine.\n\nAnswer B: Anti-IgG Fc region is representative of rheumatoid factor which is found in rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis can present with fever, weight loss, and joint pain that worsens in the morning and improves with activity. It is common for the joints of the hands to become deformed due to the disease process. Treatment is with methotrexate.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are likely positive in this patient; however, they are not more likely to aid in making the diagnosis than anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies are. ANA are non-specific and can be found in many rheumatological conditions such as MCTD, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAnswer E: Anti-Ro antibodies are found in Sjogren syndrome which presents with dry eyes, dry mouth, dental caries, and dyspareunia. A salivary gland biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes artificial tears, vitamin D supplementation, and pilocarpine or cevimeline.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMixed connective tissue disease is associated with anti-ribonuleoprotein antibodies and presents with Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgia/arthritis, swollen hands, sclerodactyly, and myositis.",

Supportive care is the most appropriate management strategy for patients with viral meningitis.\n\nAseptic (viral) meningitis presents similarly to bacterial meningitis with neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, malaise, and flu-like symptoms. Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose. CSF should be sent for Gram stain and culture to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial meningitis. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, management of viral meningitis consists of supportive care and monitoring for complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or SIADH.\n\nKohil et. al review viral meningitis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestation and diagnosis. They recommend that most patients with viral meningitis be treated with supportive care.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acyclovir would be appropriate for suspected HSV or varicella encephalitis or meningitis. This patient with no RBCs in the CSF and no changes in mental status is not likely to have infection with HSV or varicella.\n\nAnswer B: Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine followed by long-term fluconazole is the appropriate management of cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis presents similarly to bacterial and viral meningitis, almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients.\n\nAnswer C: Ceftriaxone and vancomycin would be appropriate if bacterial meningitis was suspected. Steroids are generally added if a bacterial source is likely. However, this patient has a presentation that is less concerning for bacterial meningitis, and CSF studies that are more consistent with aseptic meningitis.\n\nAnswer D: Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and steroids are an appropriate initial regimen for bacterial meningitis.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with both absence seizures (periods of inattentiveness in school) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (abnormal, involuntary spasms of her upper extremity). The most appropriate treatment for these conditions is valproic acid.\n\nAbsence seizures classically present with cessation of motor activity and speech with a blank facial expression and occasionally automatisms such as flickering of the eyelids. They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile. They recommend using valproic acid if there are concurrent seizure conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Carbamazepine would be the appropriate therapy for a partial seizure (tonic or clonic movements in addition to an absence of a post-ictal period) or for trigeminal neuralgia (sudden pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve). It would not address both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nAnswer B: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a useful treatment that helps a patient develop coping strategies and change unhelpful patterns of thought. It could be useful if this girl was having trouble focusing in school for another reason (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder); however, it is not useful in managing seizures.\n\nAnswer C: Ethosuximide is the most appropriate initial therapy for absence seizures. In this patient, she is suffering from both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which could not be treated by ethosuximide alone, in contrast to valproic acid which could treat both conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic that can also be used as a mood stabilizer. It carries the potentially severe side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is not a first-line treatment for absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Stevens-Johnson syndrome will present with painful desquamation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAbsence seizures present with periods of inattentiveness and subtle automatisms and are most appropriately treated with ethosuximide or with valproic acid if there is concurrent juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

Differential Diagnosis:**\n- The new pulmonary findings could suggest an opportunistic infection, such as tuberculosis (TB) or a fungal infection, given his history of immunosuppression.\n- The rapid improvement in CD4 count and viral load suggests immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), where the recovering immune system mounts an inflammatory response to existing infections.\n\n**C.

It can manifest as worsening of pre-existing infections.\n- Continuing ART is crucial to maintain immune recovery.\n- High-dose glucocorticoids are sometimes used to manage severe IRIS, but discontinuing ART is not recommended as it would reverse immune recovery.\n- Determining drug sensitivities (Option B) is important if a specific infection is suspected, but the immediate management of IRIS is more pressing.\n- Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment (Option C) is not appropriate without clear evidence of resolution of infection.\n- Obtaining a D-dimer level (Option D) is not relevant to the current clinical picture, which is more suggestive of IRIS or an opportunistic infection.\n\n**D. Conclusion:**\nGiven the clinical presentation and the likelihood of IRIS, the most appropriate next step is to manage the inflammatory response while continuing ART. High-dose glucocorticoids can be used to manage severe IRIS symptoms.\n\n**Answer:**\n(E) Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy\n\n(Note: The discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy in option E is incorrect; the correct approach would be to continue ART while managing IRIS with glucocorticoids. However, based on the options provided, E is the closest to addressing the IRIS component, albeit with the incorrect suggestion to discontinue ART.)",

If the patient is experiencing IRIS, continuing ART is generally recommended, but additional management may be needed.\n\n(B) **Determine drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection**: This option is relevant if there is suspicion of drug-resistant infection. However, the scenario suggests a new inflammatory response rather than resistance.\n\n(C) **Discontinue antimicrobial treatment**: Discontinuing antimicrobials without clear evidence of resolution or misdiagnosis is not advisable, especially in an immunocompromised patient.\n\n(D) **Obtain a D-dimer level**: This test is used to evaluate for thromboembolic events, which is not the primary concern here given the presentation.\n\n(E) **Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy**: High-dose glucocorticoids can be used to manage severe IRIS, but discontinuing ART is generally not recommended unless life-threatening IRIS occurs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most appropriate next step, considering the possibility of IRIS, is to manage the inflammatory response while continuing ART. High-dose glucocorticoids can be used to control severe IRIS symptoms. Discontinuing ART is not typically recommended unless the situation is life-threatening, which is not indicated here.\n\n**Answer:**\n(E) Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy"

She feels fatigued, depressed, and has gained 10 pounds which she attributes to feeling too weak to go to the gym. She was recently treated for an ear infection with an antibiotic which she completed 3 weeks ago, and experienced a rash which she believes was an allergic reaction to her treatment. The patient has a medical history of diabetes mellitus that is well-controlled with insulin and metformin. She has been admitted multiple times for hypoglycemia secondary to missing meals. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

A muscle biopsy in this disease will demonstrate endomysial inflammation with basophilic-rimmed vacuoles within the muscle fiber sarcoplasm. Electromyography is typically abnormal, and the most accurate/confirmatory test is a muscle biopsy. There is no cure for this disease and no standard course of treatment. Corticosteroids are not usually effective but intravenous immunoglobulins can be effective.\n\nNaddaf et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with inclusion body myositis. They discuss how this disease is still refractory to treatment. They recommend a muscle biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a muscle biopsy demonstrating endomysial inflammation with basophilic-rimmed vacuoles (red circle) within the muscle fiber sarcoplasm. These findings are classically seen in patients with inclusion body myositis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 5: Dermatomyositis and polymyositis present similarly with muscle weakness and an elevated CK, CRP, and aldolase. However, dermatomyositis presents with dermatologic findings. A biopsy would demonstrate inflammation surrounding the muscle fascicle (dermatomyositis) or within the muscle fascicle (polymyositis). Treatment may include azathioprine and methotrexate.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia could present with weakness and cardiac abnormalities. Though this patient is hypokalemic, her biopsy demonstrates inclusion body myositis. Treatment of hypokalemia is with potassium repletion.\n\nAnswer C: Hypothyroidism presents with depression, fatigue, scarce lanugo, myopathy, and weight gain (as this patient has). Though myopathy from hypothyroidism is plausible, her symptoms of weakness have a confirmatory biopsy.

The rash and muscle weakness could fit, but the sparse hair and hypoglycemia are not typical. Muscle biopsy would show perifascicular atrophy.\n\n- **(B) Hypokalemia:** Low potassium can cause muscle weakness, but it does not explain the rash, sparse hair, or other systemic symptoms.\n\n- **(C) Hypothyroidism:** Can cause fatigue, weight gain, depression, muscle weakness, sparse hair, and low glucose levels. The rash is less typical but possible. Hypothyroidism can cause hypokalemia due to metabolic changes.\n\n- **(D) Inclusion Body Myositis:** Typically presents with muscle weakness, especially in older adults, but the rash and sparse hair are not characteristic. Muscle biopsy would show rimmed vacuoles.\n\n- **(E) Polymyositis:** Causes muscle weakness but not typically associated with rash or sparse hair. Muscle biopsy would show endomysial inflammation.\n\n**Updated Answer:**\n\n**(C) Hypothyroidism** is the most likely explanation for this patient's presentation. The combination of fatigue, weight gain, depression, muscle weakness, sparse hair, and low glucose levels aligns well with hypothyroidism. While the rash is not classic for hypothyroidism, it can occur. The low potassium level can be explained by metabolic changes associated with hypothyroidism. The muscle biopsy would likely show changes consistent with hypothyroid myopathy, such as muscle fiber atrophy. This diagnosis fits the overall clinical picture better than the other options, which have inconsistencies with the symptoms and laboratory findings.",

While hypothyroidism explains many symptoms, the presence of a rash and the specific muscle weakness pattern may suggest a myositis condition. Dermatomyositis is known for both muscle weakness and rash, and the muscle biopsy would typically show inflammatory changes consistent with this diagnosis.\n\n### Updated Answer\n\n**(A) Dermatomyositis**\n\nDermatomyositis is the most likely explanation for this patient's presentation, given the combination of muscle weakness, rash, and the potential findings on muscle biopsy. While hypothyroidism explains many symptoms, the presence of a rash and the specific muscle weakness pattern align more closely with dermatomyositis."

Treatment involves treating any electrolyte abnormalities, encouraging ambulation, and avoiding medications that decrease peristalsis (such as opioids).\n\nAnswer C: Ogilvie syndrome occurs when the colon wall is not appropriately undergoing peristalsis leading to a dilated colon with abdominal distension. It is more common in the elderly and critically ill patients. Treatment involves the placement of a rectal tube to decompress the intestines and treatment of any underlying medical conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Sigmoid volvulus is more common in elderly and critically ill patients and presents with constipation, an absence of bowel movements, and a distended, tympanitic abdomen. Although the coffee bean sign may also be seen in patients with sigmoid volvulus, patients tend to be older. In addition, plain radiography typically demonstrates multiple air-fluid levels in a sigmoid volvulus versus usually only a single air-fluid level in a cecal volvulus. Treatment involves flexible sigmoidoscopy and surgery.\n\nAnswer E: Small bowel obstruction presents with a distended and tympanitic abdomen with nausea, vomiting, and an absence of flatus or bowel movements. Radiography may demonstrate distended bowel and air-fluid levels, and the most accurate test is a CT scan of the abdomen. It occurs secondary to adhesions entrapping the bowel. Management involves the placement of a nasogastric tube, intravenous fluids, and surgery.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCecal volvulus presents in younger patients with abdominal pain, distention, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and the \"coffee bean\" sign on radiography.",

The increased PTH results in renal phosphate wasting, increased production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and increased renal calcium reabsorption. It also results in increased osteoclast activity resulting in increased bone breakdown.

This patient does not have metabolic alkalosis. Treatment is with the discontinuation of the offending agent.\n\nAnswer B: Increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D occurs in sarcoidosis which presents with cough, fatigue, and weight loss in an African American woman. Increased vitamin D by itself will result in hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia rather than hypophosphatemia.

Laboratory Findings:**\n- Serum calcium is elevated at 12.5 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5-10.2 mg/dL).\n- Alkaline phosphatase is slightly elevated at 150 U/L (normal range: 44-147 U/L).\n- Phosphorus is low at 2.0 mg/dL (normal range: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL).\n- Other electrolytes, glucose, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within normal limits.\n- Urine sodium is low at 5 mmol/24 hours, which may indicate low dietary intake or renal conservation.\n\n**C. Analysis of Options:**\n1. **Antacid overuse (A):** Antacids, particularly those containing calcium, can lead to hypercalcemia. However, the symptoms and lab findings (especially low phosphorus) suggest a more systemic issue than simple antacid overuse.\n\n2. **Increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (B):** This could lead to increased calcium absorption and hypercalcemia. However, it typically does not cause low phosphorus levels.\n\n3. **Increased parathyroid hormone (C):** Hyperparathyroidism can cause hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia due to increased renal excretion of phosphorus. The symptoms of abdominal pain, cognitive issues, and weight loss can be associated with hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism.\n\n4. **Malignancy (D):** Certain malignancies can cause hypercalcemia, often through paraneoplastic syndromes or bone metastases. However, the normal physical exam and lack of other specific symptoms make this less likely.\n\n5. **Viral illness (E):** Viral illnesses typically do not cause hypercalcemia or the specific lab findings seen here.\n\n**D. Conclusion:**\nThe combination of hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and the patient's symptoms are most consistent with increased parathyroid hormone activity, likely primary hyperparathyroidism.

However, the patient\u2019s calcium level is quite high, and antacid overuse typically does not cause such a significant elevation unless there is excessive intake or underlying renal impairment.\n   \n2. **Increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (B):** This can lead to hypercalcemia due to increased intestinal absorption of calcium. Conditions like sarcoidosis or other granulomatous diseases can cause increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.\n\n3. **Increased Parathyroid Hormone (C):** Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common cause of hypercalcemia, characterized by elevated calcium, low phosphorus, and sometimes elevated alkaline phosphatase. The patient's presentation aligns well with hyperparathyroidism.\n\n4. **Malignancy (D):** Malignancy can cause hypercalcemia, often through paraneoplastic syndromes or bone metastases. However, the patient\u2019s presentation lacks specific signs of malignancy, and the normal physical exam makes this less likely.\n\n5. **Viral Illness (E):** Viral illnesses typically do not cause hypercalcemia. The symptoms and lab findings do not align with a viral etiology.\n\nE. **Conclusion:**\nGiven the elevated calcium, low phosphorus, and slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase, the most likely explanation is increased parathyroid hormone, which is consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism.

She denies dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea. The patient had a myocardial infarction 6 months ago, and she now has multiple drug-eluting stents. Her ECG upon discharge from that hospitalization was normal. The patient has been taking all of her medications as instructed. Her medical history is otherwise significant for rheumatoid arthritis and migraines. Her home medications include methotrexate, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and aspirin. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 118/75 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 12/min. On physical exam, she has an irregular heartbeat with normal cardiac sounds. Her abdomen is non-distended and she has mild lower extremity edema. Her current ECG can be seen in Figure A.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with lightheadedness and is found to have progressive prolongation of the PR interval on ECG most likely has Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block. Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular node dysfunction.\n\nSecond degree heart block can be divided into Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2 patterns. The Mobitz type 1 pattern is usually a result of dysfunction at the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the Mobitz type 2 pattern is usually caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. In Mobitz type 1 2nd-degree heart block, the PR interval becomes progressively longer with each beat before the dropped QRS complex. In Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block, the PR intervals are consistent in length and the dropped QRS complexes occur at regular intervals. The easiest way to determine whether the PR interval is getting longer is to compare the PR interval just before the dropped beat to the PR interval immediately following the dropped beat. Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block. They discuss how a type 1 2nd-degree heart block is caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. They recommend symptomatic treatment of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG that demonstrates the progressive prolongation of the PR interval (blue lines) until a beat is dropped. This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia. Sinoatrial node dysfunction can be treated with pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped QRS complex and is usually caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node.",

She has multiple drug-eluting stents and is on medications including methotrexate, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and aspirin. Her vital signs are stable, but she has an irregular heartbeat and mild lower extremity edema.\n\n2. **Symptoms Analysis:** The dizziness and lightheadedness, along with the irregular heartbeat, suggest a problem with the heart's rhythm control. The absence of dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea indicates that heart failure is not the primary issue.\n\n3. **ECG and Physical Exam:** The irregular heartbeat with normal cardiac sounds suggests an arrhythmia. The ECG findings, although not provided in detail, likely show irregularities consistent with arrhythmias.\n\n4. **Cardiac Conduction System:** The sinoatrial (SA) node is the primary pacemaker of the heart, responsible for initiating the heartbeat. Dysfunction in the SA node can lead to arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, which can cause symptoms like dizziness and lightheadedness.\n\n5. **History of Myocardial Infarction:** The patient's history of myocardial infarction increases the risk of arrhythmias due to potential damage to the cardiac conduction system. The SA node, being the primary pacemaker, is a likely candidate for dysfunction post-myocardial infarction.\n\n6. **Medication Considerations:** The patient's medications, including clopidogrel and aspirin, are typical post-myocardial infarction treatments but do not directly affect the cardiac conduction system. Methotrexate is used for rheumatoid arthritis and does not typically impact heart rhythm.\n\n7. **Conclusion:** Given the irregular heartbeat, history of myocardial infarction, and symptoms of dizziness, the SA node is the most likely affected component. This aligns with the insights from peers, suggesting SA node dysfunction leading to arrhythmias.\n\n**Updated Answer:**\n\n(E) Sinoatrial node",

This history increases the risk of arrhythmias due to potential damage to the cardiac conduction system.\n   - Her medications include methotrexate, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and aspirin, none of which are directly associated with causing arrhythmias.\n\n3. **Physical Examination and Vital Signs:**\n   - Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a pulse of 92/min, which is within normal limits but could be irregular.\n   - The presence of mild lower extremity edema could suggest some degree of heart failure or venous insufficiency, but it is not directly indicative of the conduction system issue.\n\n4. **ECG Findings:**\n   - The ECG is crucial in determining the affected component of the cardiac conduction system. While the specific details of the ECG are not provided here, the irregular heartbeat suggests a problem with the initiation or propagation of electrical impulses in the heart.\n\n5. **Analysis of Cardiac Conduction System Components:**\n   - **Sinoatrial Node (SA Node):** The primary pacemaker of the heart, responsible for initiating the heartbeat. Dysfunction here can lead to irregular heartbeats and symptoms like dizziness.\n   - **Atrioventricular Node (AV Node):** Responsible for delaying the impulse from the atria to the ventricles. Dysfunction can lead to heart block, but typically presents with bradycardia rather than irregular heartbeat.\n   - **Bundle of His, Bundle Branches, Purkinje Fibers:** These components are involved in the propagation of impulses through the ventricles. Dysfunction typically leads to specific types of block or bundle branch block, which would be evident on the ECG.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the symptoms of dizziness and irregular heartbeat, along with the history of myocardial infarction, the most likely affected component is the **Sinoatrial Node**.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with poorly managed hypertension over a long period of time most likely has compensatory hypertrophy of the heart. The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole. Treatment is by meticulous control of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology such as hypertension.\n\nKino et al studied the relationship between the S1 and S4 heart sounds in aging patients. They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber. Treatment is with diuresis and treatment of the underlying heart failure.\n\nAnswer D: A holosystolic murmur heard at the apex describes mitral valve regurgitation. This would be possible if a papillary muscle had ruptured in an acute myocardial infarction. Treatment is with mitral valve replacement in symptomatic patients.\n\nAnswer E: A normal S1 and S2 is possible but is less likely given this patient's long-standing history of poorly managed hypertension. Hypertension usually causes concentric hypertrophy of the ventricle and thereby leads to increased resistance to diastolic filling.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAn S4 heart sound is created by blood entering a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle and is often heard in patients with long-standing hypertension.",

The elevated blood pressure and history of myocardial infarction further support the likelihood of mitral regurgitation.\n\nAll three medical experts\u2014Innovative Medical Thinker, Critical Medical Analyst, and Clinical Decision Specialist\u2014concur that option (D), a holosystolic murmur at the apex, is the most accurate representation of the expected cardiac finding on physical examination. This consensus is based on the alignment of the patient's clinical history, symptoms, and the typical complications associated with myocardial infarction.\n\nTherefore, the final decision, supported by the detailed rationale provided by the experts, is:\n\nFinal Answer: D",

Fresh frozen plasma is the most effective therapy for hereditary angioedema of the options listed.\n\nAngioedema is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with severe edema of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. It can be caused by antigens, medications, and trauma or may occur spontaneously. It often presents with notable edema of the lips and tongue and may threaten the airway. There are 3 subtypes. Hereditary and acquired angioedema occur secondary to a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. As a result, the most effective therapy is to administer fresh frozen plasma which has C1-esterase inhibitor. On the other hand, drug-induced angioedema (often from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) does not respond well to C1-esterase inhibitor replacement and supportive therapy; discontinuing the offending agent is the mainstay of therapy. Other effective but costly treatments that can be used in hereditary angioedema include: icatibant, ecallantide, and C1 inhibitor.\n\nPaige and Anderson note the management of hereditary angioedema. They review the different treatments and discuss C1-esterase inhibitor replacement. They recommend this treatment for acute episodes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Dexamethasone and other steroids can be given in acute allergic reactions and may reduce the recurrence of symptoms but are unlikely to be effective in angioedema, nor are they the most effective therapy. Steroids can take up to 4 hours to begin having any effect.\n\nAnswer B: Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that could be given for anaphylaxis or urticaria and works immediately; however, it is not the mainstay of therapy for angioedema nor is it the most effective therapy. It is the mainstay of therapy for urticaria. It can also be given in anaphylaxis.\n\nAnswer C: Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis which presents with urticaria, upper airway swelling, hypotension, nausea/vomiting, and wheezing. It is often given in angioedema but has limited efficacy when compared to fresh frozen plasma.\n\nAnswer E: Tranexamic acid is effective in treating angioedema and current evidence supports its use; however, the mainstay of therapy is still fresh frozen plasma. Tranexamic acid is also used in hemorrhagic shock to stop fibrinolysis and reduce bleeding.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA possible treatment in hereditary or acquired angioedema is the administration of fresh frozen plasma to replace C1-esterase inhibitor.",

Patient Presentation and Symptoms\n- **Age and Gender**: 22-year-old man.\n- **Symptoms**: Difficulty breathing, significant swelling of lips and tongue, muffled voice.\n- **Vital Signs**: Normal temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and oxygen saturation.\n- **Physical Exam**: Swollen lips, enlarged tongue, clear breath sounds, no rash, soft and nontender abdomen.\n\n### B. Clinical Context\n- The patient has experienced similar symptoms before, suggesting a recurrent condition.\n- The acute swelling of the lips and tongue following trauma (hit in the face with a football) is indicative of angioedema.\n- The absence of rash and normal vital signs, particularly the normal oxygen saturation, suggest that this is not anaphylaxis, which typically presents with more systemic involvement.\n\n### C. Differential Diagnosis\n- **Angioedema**: Given the recurrent nature and the specific swelling of lips and tongue, angioedema is the most likely diagnosis. This can be hereditary (C1 inhibitor deficiency) or acquired.\n- **Anaphylaxis**: Less likely due to the absence of rash and stable vital signs.\n\n### D. Treatment Options\n- **(A) Dexamethasone**: A corticosteroid that can reduce inflammation but is not the first-line treatment for acute angioedema.\n- **(B) Diphenhydramine**: An antihistamine that is useful in allergic reactions but not effective for angioedema, especially if it is hereditary.\n- **(C) Epinephrine**: Used in anaphylaxis for its vasoconstrictive and bronchodilatory effects.

The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing, significant swelling of the lips and tongue, and a muffled voice after being hit in the face with a football. These symptoms are indicative of angioedema, which is characterized by sudden swelling in the deeper layers of the skin, often affecting the face, lips, tongue, and throat. The absence of a rash and the normal vital signs suggest that this is not an allergic reaction like anaphylaxis, but rather a localized swelling.\n\nGiven the patient's history of similar symptoms, hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a possible diagnosis. HAE is often triggered by trauma or stress and is due to a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitor, leading to increased bradykinin levels and subsequent swelling. The most effective treatment for acute attacks of hereditary angioedema is to address the underlying deficiency.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Dexamethasone - A corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation, but not effective for acute hereditary angioedema attacks.\n\n(B) Diphenhydramine - An antihistamine used for allergic reactions, but not effective for bradykinin-mediated angioedema.\n\n(C) Epinephrine - Used for anaphylaxis, but not effective for hereditary angioedema as it does not address bradykinin-mediated swelling.\n\n(D) Fresh frozen plasma - Contains C1 esterase inhibitor and can be used to treat acute attacks of hereditary angioedema by replenishing the deficient protein.\n\n(E) Tranexamic acid - An antifibrinolytic agent sometimes used for prophylaxis in hereditary angioedema, but not for acute attacks.\n\nConsidering the mechanism of hereditary angioedema and the need to replenish C1 esterase inhibitor, the most effective therapy for this patient is:\n\n**Answer:**\n\n(D) Fresh frozen plasma",

In developed countries, these typically occur secondary to adhesions.\n\nSmall bowel obstructions (SBO) typically present with an absence of bowel sounds, bowel movements, and flatus, as well as abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting. They typically occur secondary to adhesions which entrap the bowel and disrupt its normal peristalsis. Adhesions can occur after abdominal surgery or trauma as part of the normal healing process. The diagnosis of SBO can be confirmed using abdominal imaging such as a CT scan. Treatment often involves observation; however, surgical decompression of the SBO may be needed if there is a closed-loop obstruction or an obstruction that does not resolve on its own.\n\nRami Reddy and Cappell review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of SBO. They discuss how this disease has a 30% mortality rate if the diagnosis is missed and bowel perforation occurs. They recommend early evaluation and treatment of these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Enteric nervous system damage describes diabetic gastroparesis which can present similarly to SBO; however, this patient's age and history of surgery points toward SBO as the most likely diagnosis. Treatment is with pro-motility agents.\n\nAnswer C: Impacted stool describes constipation which could present similarly to SBO; however, this diagnosis is less likely to cause nausea and vomiting unless it is severe. The vomit typically smells like stool. Treatment is with dis-impaction of the colon.\n\nAnswer D: Norovirus typically causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea but does not cause distension and a tympanitic abdomen. Treatment is supportive as the virus self-resolves.\n\nAnswer E: Twisting of bowel describes a volvulus which presents similarly to SBO; however, it is a more common diagnosis in the elderly and is a less common diagnosis than is SBO in a patient with a history of abdominal surgery. Treatment is with surgical untwisting of the bowel.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSmall bowel obstruction (commonly caused by adhesions) presents with nausea, vomiting, absence of flatus/bowel movements, and a distended/tympanic abdomen.",

Nasal foreign bodies tend to be unilateral (though bilateral symptoms are plausible) and present with a purulent and bloody discharge. The treatment of choice is to remove the object which may be done in the emergency department or operating room depending on how deep the object is. Visualization of the object should be attempted when possible in order to allow for safe retrieval.\n\nKrulewitz and Fix review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epistaxis. They discuss how foreign body insertion is a major risk factor for the development of epistaxis. They recommend assessment of airway and breathing in the setting of severe epistaxis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: A bleeding and infected vessel of the Kiesselbach plexus could suggest a complicated case of epistaxis. The persistent, unilateral symptoms in this patient point toward a different diagnosis. A high index of suspicion for foreign bodies should be suspected in children.\n\nAnswer C: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to occur in young male patients and can be associated with infectious mononucleosis. Epistaxis can be a symptom and the mass can be visualized. This disease tends to present in older patients and is far less common than foreign bodies. Treatment is with surgical resection.\n\nAnswer D: Septal perforation can occur secondary to repeat cocaine use but would not present with unilateral nasal discharge in a pediatric patient. It would be highly unlikely in a pediatric patient with no history of drug use. Treatment is with cessation of the offending agent.\n\nAnswer E: Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection would typically present with systemic symptoms as well as bilateral symptoms.
