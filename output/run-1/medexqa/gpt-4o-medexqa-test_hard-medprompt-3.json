It is too high and does not align with typical recommendations for cane use.\n   - **Option C:** \"At the height of the fingertips when the elbow is fully extended\" - This option is incorrect because it would result in a cane that is too low, as the fingertips would be closer to the ground when the arm is fully extended.\n   - **Option D:** \"At the height of the greater trochanter\" - The greater trochanter is a bony prominence on the femur near the hip.

Electrical stimulation therapy:** This option is a therapeutic approach often used in medical treatments, such as for muscle stimulation or nerve therapy.\n\n3. **Provide the final answer:**\n   - Given the options, \"Electrical stimulation therapy\" (Option D) is the most likely remedial approach in a therapeutic or medical context, as it directly involves a treatment method. Options A and C are more about modifying food, which might be relevant in dietary adjustments but not necessarily a direct remedial approach.

        "final_solution": "To answer the question about the number of electrodes used in the 3-channel method of a 24-hour (Holter) electrocardiogram, let's follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Consider relevant information from examples:**\n   - The examples provided are about identifying incorrect characteristics or descriptions related to specific devices or phenomena. They don't directly relate to the number of electrodes used in a Holter electrocardiogram, but they do illustrate the process of elimination and reasoning based on known facts.\n\n2. **Compare and eliminate incorrect choices:**\n   - A standard 3-channel Holter monitor typically uses more than 3 electrodes to capture comprehensive data from different parts of the heart. This is because each channel requires at least two electrodes to measure the electrical activity between them, and additional electrodes are often used for grounding or reference.\n   - Option C (3 electrodes) is likely incorrect because it would not provide enough electrodes for a 3-channel setup.\n   - Option A (5 electrodes) is a common configuration for a 3-channel Holter monitor, as it allows for multiple leads to be placed in strategic positions to capture detailed heart activity.\n   - Option B (7 electrodes) and Option D (11 electrodes) are less common for a standard 3-channel setup, as they typically involve more complex monitoring systems.\n\n3. **Provide the final answer:**\n   - Based on typical configurations for a 3-channel Holter monitor, the most common number of electrodes used is 5.\n\nFinal answer: A. 5"

Therefore, tasks with visual cues are easier than those without.\n\n2. **Far from hearing aid \u2192 Close to hearing aid**: Being closer to a hearing aid typically improves sound clarity and volume, making listening easier. Thus, \"Far from hearing aid\" is more difficult than \"Close to hearing aid.\"\n\n3. **Background noise present \u2192 No background noise**: Background noise complicates listening tasks, making them more difficult. Therefore, \"Background noise present\" is more difficult than \"No background noise.\"\n\n4. **Soft sounds \u2192 Loud sounds**: Loud sounds are generally easier to hear than soft sounds, especially for individuals with hearing impairments. Thus, \"Soft sounds\" are more difficult than \"Loud sounds.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct order of difficulty levels from easier to more difficult is:\n\nA.

It is driven by concentration gradients and does not necessarily imply movement in only one direction.\n\n2. **Active transport**: This involves the movement of substances against their concentration gradient, which requires energy (usually in the form of ATP).
