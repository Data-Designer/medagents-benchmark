The patient is a 45\u2010year\u2010old multiparous woman (G5P4105) with several months of worsening dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding requiring frequent use of a super absorbent tampon, and intermenstrual bleeding. In addition, she describes dyspareunia and a feeling of pelvic heaviness. These symptoms are strongly suggestive of adenomyosis.\n\nStep 2: Recall the physical exam findings in adenomyosis. Adenomyosis is characterized by endometrial tissue within the myometrium, leading to uterine hyperplasia. This usually presents as a uniformly enlarged, globular, and \u201cboggy\u201d uterus, which can be tender on palpation. The enlargement is proportional (typically around 8\u201310 weeks\u2019 gestational size) and not irregular.\n\nStep 3: Compare with the answer options.\n(A) Globular 10-week sized uterus \u2013 This is consistent with the typical exam findings of adenomyosis.\n(B) Adnexal mass \u2013 This is more suggestive of ovarian or tubal pathology, not adenomyosis.\n(C) Irregular 14-week sized uterus \u2013 An irregular, larger uterus is more characteristic of leiomyomas (fibroids).\n(D) No remarkable physical exam finding \u2013 Given her symptomatology, a uterine abnormality is expected.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion. The history and symptoms lead to the most probable diagnosis of adenomyosis, whose physical exam finding is a uniformly enlarged (globular) uterus, approximately 10 weeks in size.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA",

Follicular lymphoma is known to be associated with the t(14;18) translocation, which juxtaposes the BCL-2 gene (on chromosome 18) next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (on chromosome 14). This results in an overexpression of the BCL-2 protein.\n\nStep 2: Understand that BCL-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein. Its overexpression prevents the normal programmed cell death (apoptosis), thereby promoting the survival of the malignant lymphocytes.\n\nStep 3: Recall that one of the key steps in the apoptosis pathway involves the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, which in turn helps form the apoptosome that activates caspase-9, an initiator caspase essential for driving the cascade that leads to cell death.\n\nStep 4: With BCL-2 overexpressed, the release of cytochrome c is inhibited, resulting in decreased activation of caspase-9. Therefore, the regulation of caspase-9 is most abnormal in this patient.\n\nAnswer: A",

This is described as an endomysial (i.e., within the fascicle) inflammatory infiltrate.\n\u2022 Option (A) \u201cIntrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy\u201d is a way to describe such an endomysial process, while option (B) \u201cPerifascicular and perivascular infiltration\u201d is characteristic of dermatomyositis.\n\u2022 The other options relate to myasthenia gravis (C) and Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy (D), which do not correlate with this patient\u2019s clinical presentation.\n\nStep 5: Final Answer\nThe findings are most consistent with polymyositis, which is best confirmed by a muscle biopsy showing inflammatory infiltrates within the fascicles of muscle fibers.\n\nThe answer is: A.",

The white pulp consists largely of lymphoid tissue (T and B lymphocytes), and the marginal zone sits at the boundary between the white and red pulp. This marginal zone is rich in macrophages and IgM memory B cells that are critical for opsonizing encapsulated bacteria. The red pulp, on the other hand, is primarily responsible for filtering the blood and removing old or damaged red blood cells.\n\nStep 2: Understand the clinical context. In patients with sickle-cell disease, repeated microinfarcts can lead to functional hyposplenism (or surgical removal results in asplenia), removing the marginal zone (and sometimes parts of the white pulp) that are essential for mounting an effective immune response to encapsulated organisms like Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This is why such patients require vaccinations against these organisms.\n\nStep 3: Identify the specific zone implicated. In the diagram provided (with zones likely denoted by numbers), the marginal zone is the one primarily involved in clearing these encapsulated bacteria. The immune dysfunction that predisposes this patient to the mentioned infections is due to impairment of the marginal zone (typically marked as number 2 in standard diagrams of splenic architecture).\n\nStep 4: Choose the answer.

Warfarin is typically administered in doses of a few milligrams per day (often 5 mg), and it has a relatively long half\u2010life (\u224840 hours). Calculating roughly, if a 5 mg dose is eliminated gradually over about 40 hours, the average elimination rate would be approximately 5 mg divided by 40 hours, which equals about 0.125 mg per hour. Multiplying by 4 hours gives roughly 0.5 mg eliminated per 4\u2011hour interval.\n\nStep 2: The other options have different dosing regimens or elimination characteristics. Enoxaparin (a low\u2013molecular\u2013weight heparin) is dosed in larger mg amounts and is not typically monitored by measuring mg elimination from serum samples. Fondaparinux is usually administered at doses like 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for prophylaxis, and its elimination profile doesn\u2019t match a steady 0.5 mg every 4 hours. Apixaban is given in doses (commonly 5 mg twice daily) that would lead to a different elimination pattern.\n\nStep 3: Based on the matching calculation for warfarin (0.5 mg eliminated every 4 hours from a daily dose given its elimination half-life), warfarin is the most likely drug consumed by the patient in this study.\n\nAnswer: A",

One standard treatment for anovulatory infertility (common in conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome [PCOS]) is the use of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), clomiphene citrate. Clomiphene is typically given in a cyclic (intermittent) fashion early in the menstrual cycle (usually administered for 5 days starting about a week before menses) to block estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus. This blockade reduces the negative feedback of estrogen, thereby increasing GnRH release and subsequently increasing pituitary FSH and LH secretion, promoting follicular maturation and ovulation.\n\nStep 2: The question asks, \u201cif the most likely drug prescribed in this case was administered in a different manner, which of the following conditions may also be treated by this drug?\u201d Although in women clomiphene is used intermittently to induce ovulation, its use in women with PCOS (an endocrine abnormality that the patient\u2019s family history might hint at) is an established treatment. In fact, clomiphene citrate is the first\u2010line therapy to induce ovulation in women with PCOS who are infertile.\n\nOptions such as diabetes, Parkinson disease, and prostate cancer are not treated by SERMs like clomiphene. However, when considering that clomiphene citrate is used differently (i.e., addressing the ovulatory dysfunction in women with PCOS by adjusting its dosing schedule), PCOS is the condition that can be treated with this drug depending on timing and clinical circumstance.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nC",

Additionally, there is an indurated red patch on his leg with surrounding erythema and local swelling. He has enlarged lymph nodes. He also has a history of recent travel to Thailand, Ethiopia, and Brazil.\n\nStep 2: Consider differential diagnoses based on travel history and clinical findings. The combination of cutaneous lesions (red indurated patch on the leg) and involvement of the eyelid suggests an infectious process that could have a cutaneous manifestation with possible mucosal or ocular involvement. Given his travel to Brazil and other tropical regions, cutaneous leishmaniasis (or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis) is highly suspicious.\n\nStep 3: Identify the treatment. The treatment for cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, especially when caused by species such as Leishmania braziliensis (common in Brazil), is generally with pentavalent antimonials. Among the provided options, sodium stibogluconate is the pentavalent antimonial used.\n\nStep 4: Consider the other options. Benznidazole is used for Chagas disease, Ivermectin is used for infections like onchocerciasis, and Mebendazole is used for helminth infestations. None of these are appropriate for treating leishmaniasis.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion. Based on the above reasoning, the correct treatment is sodium stibogluconate.\n\nAnswer: D",

These findings are highly suggestive of a lymphoma (most likely an aggressive B-cell lymphoma such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that is common in immunocompromised patients).\n\nStep 2: An excisional lymph node biopsy has confirmed the histopathologic diagnosis of lymphoma. The next important steps in the workup, once the diagnosis is confirmed, are to stage the disease and to identify any coexisting infections that may affect management.\n\nStep 3: Although standard lymphoma staging typically involves imaging (such as CT or PET scans) and bone marrow biopsy, the answer choices given include only laboratory tests related to other conditions.\n\nStep 4: Evaluating for hepatitis infections is important before initiating certain chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., rituximab) because hepatitis reactivation can be a serious complication. Among hepatitis viruses, hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a known association with certain B-cell lymphomas, and screening for HCV is recommended in patients who are about to undergo therapy for lymphoma.\n\nStep 5: Analysis of other provided options:\n\u2003\u2022 Antinuclear antibody (ANA) is used in evaluating autoimmune disorders and is not indicated here.\n\u2003\u2022 JAK-2 mutation testing is used for diagnosing myeloproliferative disorders, which does not fit this clinical picture.\n\u2003\u2022 Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test is used in the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia; however, hairy cell leukemia typically does not present with extensive lymphadenopathy (especially not in HIV patients) and has a different laboratory profile.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, in the context of lymphoma workup prior to treatment, the next best diagnostic step among the options provided is to check for hepatitis C virus antibodies.\n\nAnswer: B",

This cytokine activates macrophages within granulomas, leading them to express 1\u03b1-hydroxylase. This enzyme converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), which increases intestinal calcium absorption and leads to hypercalcemia.\n\nStep 3: Review the answer choices.\n(A) Excessive intake of dietary ergocalciferol \u2013 This is not consistent with the clinical picture and is an unlikely cause.\n(B) Induction of focal osteolysis by tumor cells \u2013 This mechanism is more typical of other malignancies, such as multiple myeloma, not Hodgkin lymphoma.\n(C) Secretion of \u03b3-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes \u2013 This explains the increased activation of macrophages, leading to excessive calcitriol production and resultant hypercalcemia.\n(D) Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells \u2013 This is commonly seen in squamous cell carcinomas, not Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nStep 4: Choose the most likely explanation.\nThe evidence supports that the hypercalcemia in this case is due to cytokine-driven activation (via \u03b3-interferon) of macrophages that, in turn, increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production.\n\nFinal Answer: C",

On examination, she has a characteristic rash on her malar area, periorbital regions, lateral proximal thighs, and elbows. These dermatologic findings are highly suggestive of dermatomyositis.\n3. Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that typically presents with proximal muscle weakness and characteristic skin findings such as a heliotrope rash and Gottron papules.\n4. Although other tests (such as serum ANA or CT scan) might provide supportive information, the definitive confirmatory test to diagnose dermatomyositis is a muscle biopsy which demonstrates typical histopathologic findings such as perimysial inflammation and perifascicular atrophy.\n\nThus, the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis is:\n\nA",

This clinical picture suggests statin-induced myalgia, a common adverse effect of statins that is generally dose-related.\n\nStep 2: The goal of LDL control is still important given his cardiovascular risk profile. The typical management strategy when mild to moderate myalgia occurs is to restart the statin at a lower dose or switch to another statin. This helps maintain LDL control while potentially reducing side effects.\n\nStep 3: Among the provided options, restarting rosuvastatin at a lower dose (option A) is the most appropriate next step. The other options, such as introducing fenofibrate, a different statin, or fish oils, are less favorable in this context. Fenofibrate is more commonly used for severe hypertriglyceridemia, and fish oils do not have the same lipid-lowering efficacy in terms of LDL reduction.

Given his alcohol history and the clinical features (postprandial pain that lasts several days, steatorrhea, weight loss), chronic pancreatitis is high on the list. Chronic pancreatitis leads to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (hence steatorrhea) and can result from long-term alcohol abuse.\n\nStep 3: Determine the appropriate diagnostic study. The initial imaging modality of choice for suspected chronic pancreatitis is an abdominal CT scan. CT can detect pancreatic calcifications and structural changes associated with chronic pancreatitis. While endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is useful, it is typically reserved for cases when CT findings are equivocal or additional details are needed.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer.

The notable physical exam finding is the bronze discoloration of his skin, which is typical of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison\u2019s disease). In this condition, the lack of cortisol leads to increased production of ACTH, which in turn causes hyperpigmentation.\n3. The next best step in the management of suspected primary adrenal insufficiency is to establish the diagnosis. The ACTH stimulation test is the confirmatory diagnostic test for adrenal insufficiency.\n4. Treatments such as hydrocortisone (with or without fludrocortisone) are initiated following confirmation of the diagnosis via appropriate testing.\n5. Therefore, the correct next step is to order an ACTH stimulation test.\n\nAnswer: D",
        "thinking": "The passage discusses a patient with symptoms indicative of primary adrenal insufficiency, focusing on the importance of confirming the diagnosis through the ACTH stimulation test as the next best step.

The patient is a 55\u2010year\u2010old man who recently had knee replacement surgery and has been bed\u2010bound, putting him at high risk for venous thromboembolism.\n2. He presents with sudden onset dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, and pleuritic chest pain\u2014all of which are concerning signs for a pulmonary embolism (PE).\n3. Additionally, the presence of calf pain on dorsiflexion raises suspicion for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) as the source of the embolus.\n4. The chest X-ray is normal and the ECG only shows sinus tachycardia, which can be seen in PE but are not diagnostic.\n5. In a hemodynamically unstable patient with a high clinical suspicion for PE, a confirmation of DVT via a lower extremity doppler can support the diagnosis swiftly. Finding a DVT in the setting of these symptoms is sufficient to start treatment.\n6. Options such as a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan are useful in diagnosing PE but may not be the most practical initial investigation in an unstable patient, whereas initiating therapy with anticoagulation (e.g., subcutaneous fondaparinux) without confirming the diagnosis may be premature.\n7. The inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is typically reserved for patients who cannot be anticoagulated or those with recurrent embolic events despite adequate anticoagulation, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the best next step in management is to rapidly evaluate for a DVT with a lower extremity doppler examination.\n\nAnswer: D",

Women with ASD may remain asymptomatic until the additional hemodynamic burden of pregnancy unmasks or worsens symptoms.\n\nStep 2: During pregnancy there are a few key cardiovascular changes. Overall, blood volume increases by approximately 40\u201350%, which in turn increases the preload and contributes to an increase in cardiac output (by about 30\u201350%). The heart rate also increases modestly while systemic vascular resistance decreases. While several of these changes are inter-related, the primary alteration that increases the volume load on the heart and thereby exaggerates the left-to-right shunt in an ASD is the increase in blood volume.\n\nStep 3: The increased blood volume increases the flow across the ASD resulting in more pronounced right heart overload. This change accentuates the murmur and can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea and dizziness as observed in this patient.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the physiological pregnancy change causing the change in this patient\u2019s condition is best attributed to the increased blood volume.\n\nAnswer: D",

She reports exposure to a sister diagnosed with rubella 10 days ago.\n\nStep 2: Review Serology Findings\nHer serology from 1 year ago showed:\n\u2022 Rubella IgM: Negative\n\u2022 Rubella IgG: 1:128\n\u2022 Rubella IgG avidity: High\n\nThe current serology is:\n\u2022 Rubella IgM: Negative\n\u2022 Rubella IgG: 1:64\n\u2022 Rubella IgG avidity: High\n\nA high IgG avidity suggests that the antibodies are from a past infection or immunization, indicating that the immune system has had time to mature the response. The absence of IgM antibodies and the presence of IgG with high avidity indicate that there is no recent rubella infection.\n\nStep 3: Management Decision\nSince the patient already has immunity to rubella (as evidenced by her IgG positivity and high avidity), and there is no serological evidence of a new, active infection, she is not at risk for congenital rubella syndrome. Rubella vaccination is contraindicated during pregnancy, so it is recommended postpartum if needed for boosting immunity or for future pregnancies.\n\nStep 4: Choose the Correct Answer\n(A) Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum.\n\nThus, the proper next step in management is to reassure the patient and advise vaccination postpartum if indicated.\n\nAnswer: A",

This can lead to significant fluid loss with a predominance of free water loss, which may create hypernatremic dehydration.\n\nStep 2: The laboratory findings show a serum sodium of 154 mEq/L, which is clearly elevated from the normal range (~135\u2013145 mEq/L). Other electrolytes are within normal limits, though the physical exam \u2014 dry skin/mucous membranes and tachycardia \u2014 supports a state of dehydration.\n\nStep 3: The patient\u2019s altered mental status (difficult to arouse) is concerning and, along with hypernatremia, suggests that free water deficit must be corrected.\n\nStep 4: In treating hypernatremic dehydration, one must provide hypotonic fluids to gradually lower serum sodium. Although severely hypovolemic patients might first require an isotonic fluid bolus, this patient\u2019s blood pressure is not profoundly low. Instead, his hypernatremia and dehydration call for free water replacement through IV fluids.\n\nStep 5: Options such as 0.9% saline (isotonic fluid) would not help lower the sodium level since its sodium concentration is nearly identical to the patient\u2019s current serum sodium. Oral free water is not appropriate given the patient\u2019s depressed level of consciousness.\n\nStep 6: 5% dextrose in water (D5W) is effective at delivering free water intravenously after the dextrose is metabolized. In practice, a fluid that is slightly hypotonic (like 0.45% saline, or a combination such as D5W with 0.45% saline) is often preferred in hypernatremia, as it provides some sodium along with free water and is less likely to cause rapid shifts.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the most appropriate initial fluid management for this patient is to start IV fluids that will gradually replace his free water deficit while considering his volume status. The best option among those provided is:\n\n(C) 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV\n\nThus, the answer is C.",

This chronic gastrointestinal history is most consistent with an inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis.\n\u2022 She now presents with acute onset bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and systemic signs of illness.\n\u2022 Her recent past includes treatment for impetigo and a history of seizures (which is less relevant to the current findings), and she admits to occasional cocaine and alcohol use.\n\nStep 2: Examine the laboratory findings.\n\u2022 Anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dL) could be due to chronic blood loss from recurrent bloody stools.\n\u2022 The renal indices are abnormal, with an elevated BUN (37 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.8 mg/dL). The urine analysis shows a positive protein, suggesting some type of glomerular injury.\n\u2022 Liver enzymes are only mildly elevated, which is nonspecific here.\n\u2022 The urine toxicology is positive for cocaine and marijuana.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible kidney pathologies.\n\u2022 The renal findings (proteinuria and elevated creatinine) indicate glomerular involvement.\n\u2022 In a patient with a chronic inflammatory condition (like ulcerative colitis), an extraintestinal manifestation can be immune complex deposition in the kidneys\u2014for example, IgA nephropathy (Berger disease) is known to be associated with mucosal immune disorders.\n\u2022 Although the patient was treated for impetigo one month ago (which could raise suspicion for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis), her chronic gastrointestinal history makes an immune-mediated glomerulonephritis secondary to a chronic inflammatory state more likely.\n\u2022 Option (D) \u201cProtein deposition\u201d is an explanation that fits the pathophysiology of IgA nephropathy (immune complex deposition in the glomeruli) as well as other deposition diseases seen in the setting of chronic inflammation (secondary amyloidosis). In this context, IgA deposition is the most likely process.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the answer choices.\n(A) Alcohol-induced liver injury \u2013 The liver enzymes are only mildly elevated and do not explain the kidney findings.\n(B) Immune response to streptococcal infection \u2013 While post\u2010streptococcal glomerulonephritis can follow impetigo, this is less likely given her lifelong history of GI symptoms.\n(C) Intestinal IgA deficiency \u2013 IgA deficiency is associated with recurrent infections, not with glomerular deposition.\n(D) Protein deposition \u2013 This mechanism (e.g., deposition of IgA immune complexes in the glomeruli) best explains the patient\u2019s renal findings in the context of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nFinal Answer: D",

His chest radiograph shows a widened area of opacity near the heart along with bilateral infiltrates, suggesting an atypical pneumonia rather than the classic lobar pneumonia seen with Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nStep 2: Matching clinical and radiographic findings with the likely organism. The presentation (dry cough, high fever, bilateral infiltrates) is more typical for an atypical pneumonia. Among the atypical pathogens, Legionella pneumophila is notable. Although Legionella is often associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and sometimes altered mental status, the key laboratory point is its culture characteristics.\n\nStep 3: Identify microbiologic characteristics. Legionella pneumophila grows on buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar, which is a unique culture medium that incorporates charcoal and yeast extract. This is the characteristic used in microbiology to identify Legionella.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate answer choices.\n(A) \"Cultured on charcoal and yeast\" \u2013 This describes the culture requirements (BCYE agar) of Legionella pneumophila.\n(B) \"D-glutamate capsule\" \u2013 This is not associated with Legionella; it does not correspond to its known virulence factors.\n(C) \"Found in desert sand\" \u2013 This description is more in keeping with Coccidioides immitis, which is endemic to desert regions of the southwestern United States, not South America.\n(D) \"Polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule\" \u2013 This is the capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes typical lobar pneumonia rather than the bilateral infiltrates seen here.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion. Given that the description in option (A) specifically matches the growth characteristics of Legionella pneumophila, the most likely organism responsible for this patient's atypical pneumonia is Legionella.\n\nFinal answer: A",

The patient is a 58\u2010year\u2010old man with hyperlipidemia, obesity (BMI 30), and peripheral arterial disease suggested by difficulty palpating pedal pulses. He also has major depressive disorder and is taking citalopram\u2014a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor known to cause sexual dysfunction. However, note that he had not been sexually active for 3 years following his wife\u2019s death, and his erectile difficulties began only when he resumed sexual activity 8 months ago with a new partner.\n\nStep 2: Consider the differential. The causes of erectile dysfunction (ED) include an organic component (vascular insufficiency, which is supported by his risk factors), medication-induced (citalopram can cause sexual side effects), and psychogenic factors (performance anxiety, stress). The patient, however, is in a good relationship, and his mood appears stable, which makes the psychogenic cause less likely as a primary issue.\n\nStep 3: Identify the appropriate next step. Given that there are multiple potential contributing factors, it is essential to differentiate whether the ED is due to organic causes (vascular or medication-induced) or if there is a significant psychogenic component. Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) testing evaluates whether physiological erections occur during sleep. A normal result suggests a psychogenic cause, whereas an abnormal result supports an organic etiology.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the answer options.\n(A) Psychotherapy \u2013 More appropriate if ED were primarily psychogenic, but his history and exam findings lean toward an organic cause.\n(B) Penile prosthesis insertion \u2013 This is typically reserved for refractory cases after other treatments have failed.\n(C) Nocturnal penile tumescence testing \u2013 This test helps differentiate organic from psychogenic ED and is therefore an appropriate next step.\n(D) Switch citalopram to bupropion \u2013 Although SSRIs can contribute to sexual dysfunction, his exam findings (i.e., signs of vascular disease) suggest an organic etiology, and further differentiation is warranted prior to altering his depression management.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion.\nThe most appropriate next step in management is to perform nocturnal penile tumescence testing (Option C) to help confirm whether the ED is organic in nature.\n\nAnswer: C",

She has no breast development (Tanner stage I), yet her external and internal female genitalia appear normal.\n\u2022 Her height is normal (40th percentile), and her body mass index is within normal limits, ruling out some causes of pubertal delay associated with nutritional or systemic issues.\n\u2022 She is hypertensive for her age (BP 137/92).\n\nStep 2: Consider differential diagnoses.\n\u2022 In cases of delayed puberty with no breast development, one must consider conditions that result in estrogen deficiency.\n\u2022 In Turner syndrome (gonadal dysgenesis), the patient is typically short and has other stigmata, which are not present here.\n\u2022 In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (which occurs in an XY individual), there is usually breast development (via peripheral aromatization of testosterone) even though there is absent internal female reproductive anatomy.\n\u2022 Hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) would more likely cause weight gain and other features, not a normal BMI.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the provided options.\n(A) Aromatase enzyme deficiency \u2013 In 46,XX individuals, a deficiency in aromatase prevents the conversion of androgens to estrogens. This results in a lack of estrogen effects (e.g., absent breast development) despite having normal female internal genitalia. Additionally, excess androgens may cause mild virilization, and these patients can also exhibit hypertension.\n(B) Hypokalemia \u2013 This finding is more characteristic of mineralocorticoid excess (as seen in conditions like 11\u03b2\u2010hydroxylase deficiency); however, in those cases one usually sees ambiguous genitalia due to virilization from adrenal androgens. The patient\u2019s genitalia are described as normal.\n(C) XY karyotype \u2013 This is characteristic of androgen insensitivity syndrome, but such patients develop breasts (due to peripheral aromatization) and have absent (or undescended) internal female structures.\n(D) Hypercortisolism \u2013 Would typically be associated with obesity and other signs of Cushing syndrome, not a normal BMI and absent pubertal development.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion.\nGiven her absent breast development, normal female genitalia, and the possibility of hypertension linked with hormonal imbalances, the most likely additional finding is aromatase enzyme deficiency.\n\nAnswer: A",
        "thinking": "The case describes a 17-year-old girl who has not had pubertal development and does not show breast development, while having normal external and internal female genitalia. This situation points towards conditions that could cause estrogen deficiency.

The other conditions presented were evaluated, but they did not align with the patient's presentation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is aromatase enzyme deficiency.",

The immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgE, and IgG) are markedly decreased.\n\nStep 2: In an infant around 6 months old, maternal IgG levels decline, unmasking an immunodeficiency. A classic immunodeficiency with these findings is hyper-IgM syndrome. In hyper-IgM syndrome, patients cannot perform immunoglobulin class switching. The IgM level is usually normal or elevated, while IgA, IgE, and IgG are reduced. This inability to switch immunoglobulin classes is due to a defect in the interaction between T cells (usually due to a CD40L defect on T cells) and B cells. Without proper signaling (via the CD40-CD40L interaction), B cells cannot mature to produce other immunoglobulin isotypes.\n\nStep 3: Now review the answer choices:\n\u2003(A) Actin filament assembly \u2013 This is associated with disorders like Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, but it presents with eczema and thrombocytopenia.\n\u2003(B) T-cell receptor signaling \u2013 Abnormalities here are more consistent with severe combined immunodeficiency.\n\u2003(C) Microtubule polymerization \u2013 Defects here are seen in conditions like Chediak-Higashi syndrome.\n\u2003(D) B-cell maturation \u2013 Defective class switching, which is a key part of B-cell maturation, is the hallmark of hyper-IgM syndrome.\n\nSince the defect that prevents class switching directly affects B-cell maturation (even though the molecular defect is on a T cell\u2019s CD40L, it leads to impaired B-cell maturation and class switching), the best answer is:\n\nD",

With a pH of 7.1, this isn\u2019t warranted.\n(B) Switch fluids to 0.45% NaCl \u2013 Hypotonic fluids are not appropriate until the patient is hemodynamically stable and hyperglycemia is corrected.\n(C) Start IV insulin infusion \u2013 Generally required in DKA, but insulin should be delayed until potassium is corrected if the serum level is below 3.3 mEq/L.\n(D) Replace potassium intravenously \u2013 This is necessary as the potassium is dangerously low and must be corrected before initiating insulin therapy.\n\nStep 5: Choose the Best Option\nThe next best step is to replace potassium intravenously.\n\nAnswer: D",

First-line management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) involves uterotonics to stimulate uterine contractions and reduce bleeding.\n\nStep 3: Although the retained lobe should eventually be removed to definitively control the hemorrhage, the immediate management should be aimed at stopping the bleeding through uterine contraction.

Autonomic neuropathy can lead to diabetic cystopathy.\n\u2022 In diabetic cystopathy, patients lose the normal sensation of bladder fullness, leading to an inability to timely void. Over time the detrusor muscle may become underactive; thus the bladder does not contract well enough to fully expel urine.\n\u2022 This failure of complete emptying can lead to \u201coverflow incontinence,\u201d where the bladder may eventually leak small amounts of urine if it becomes overly full.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the Treatment Options\n(A) Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization\n\u2003\u2022 Bethanechol is a muscarinic agonist that stimulates detrusor contraction and helps overcome underactivity.\n\u2003\u2022 Intermittent catheterization is used to ensure complete bladder emptying, reducing the risk of overflow incontinence.\n\u2003\u2022 This treatment is appropriate for a patient with diabetic neuropathy resulting in a neurogenic bladder with incomplete emptying.\n\n(B) Bethanechol during the day and oxybutynin at night\n\u2003\u2022 Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic used in detrusor overactivity (urge incontinence) by relaxing bladder smooth muscle.\n\u2003\u2022 Combining a cholinergic (bethanechol) with an anticholinergic (oxybutynin) would have contradictory effects.\n\u2003\u2022 This combination is not appropriate in this patient\u2019s setting.\n\n(C) No recommendations needed\n\u2003\u2022 The patient is symptomatic. Not offering any treatment would be neglectful.\n\n(D) Reduce fluid intake and discontinue diuretics\n\u2003\u2022 This approach is useful if fluid overload or diuretic use was exacerbating the incontinence.\n\u2003\u2022 However, she is not on any diuretics, and the underlying problem seems to be neuropathic bladder dysfunction rather than fluid excess.\n\nStep 4: Choose the Best Answer\n\u2022 The patient\u2019s symptoms and exam findings (diabetic neuropathy) indicate a neurogenic bladder, likely with incomplete emptying (overflow incontinence).\n\u2022 The best treatment in this scenario is to stimulate detrusor contractions (with bethanechol) and to ensure that she empties the bladder via intermittent straight catheterization.\n\nAnswer: A",

The patient has had pain when urinating and difficulty starting a stream of urine for over 4 months now. He is bothered because he has to urinate about 9 times every day, including several times when he wakes up at night. A digital rectal examination revealed multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland. A CT scan shows a nodule in the right lung that measures 3 cm. An ultrasound scan of his urinary bladder and prostate shows residual urine of > 200 mL and heterogeneous findings of the prostate gland. Biopsy reveals grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma.

Additionally, the deficiency of von Willebrand factor results in decreased stabilization of factor VIII, contributing to a prolonged aPTT while leaving the PT normal.\n(D) Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) would also present with a prolonged aPTT but typically causes deep tissue bleeding and hemarthroses rather than petechiae. Also, hemarthroses and joint bleeds are characteristic, which are not described in this case.\n\nStep 4: Synthesize the information. The boy\u2019s presentation of petechiae and bruising, a normal platelet count, and a prolonged aPTT all point toward a defect in primary hemostasis and factor VIII activity.

He is asymptomatic, and there is no history or physical findings to suggest the primary or secondary stage of syphilis. Because his history is unclear regarding the timing of syphilis acquisition, he is best classified as having latent syphilis of unknown duration (which in practice is managed as late latent syphilis).\n\nStep 2: Treatment Recommendations in HIV-positive Patients\nFor syphilis in patients with HIV:\n\u2022 If the infection is clearly recognized as primary or secondary, the recommended treatment is a single intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units).\n\u2022 However, for latent syphilis of unknown duration (or late latent syphilis), the recommended treatment is benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly once weekly for 3 weeks.\nThough there is ongoing discussion regarding nuances in HIV coinfection, the current guidelines support using the three-dose regimen for latent syphilis of unknown duration in such patients.\n\nStep 3: Need for Lumbar Puncture\nA lumbar puncture is indicated when there are signs or symptoms of neurosyphilis (e.g., neurologic deficits, ocular involvement) or in certain high-risk cases. In this patient, the neurological examination is normal, and he is asymptomatic. Therefore, performing a lumbar puncture is not warranted at this time.\n\nStep 4: Follow-up Testing\nFor patients with late latent syphilis treated with the three-dose regimen, it is typically recommended to repeat RPR titers at around 6 months post-treatment (and sometimes at 12 months) to evaluate the serologic response to therapy.\n\nStep 5: Choose the Correct Option\nAmong the provided choices:\n(A) is incorrect because there are no neurologic symptoms that warrant a lumbar puncture.\n(B) is incorrect because even though the treatment is three injections, the follow-up titers should be done at 6 months rather than 3 months.\n(C) is correct: Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin and obtain titers in 6 months.\n(D) is incorrect as a single injection is used for primary or secondary syphilis, not for latent syphilis of unknown duration.\n\nDefinite Answer: C",

The correct treatment involves three weekly injections of benzathine penicillin.

Toxicology findings: The urine toxicology is positive for benzodiazepines and marijuana. Benzodiazepine use (or overdose) can cause sedation and confusion.\n\n3. Urine dipstick findings: The dark appearance with a positive test for red blood cells suggests the presence of pigment, such as myoglobin, rather than true hematuria.

In other words, residents in good standing are permitted to moonlight provided that the total number of duty hours (including moonlighting) does not exceed 80 hours per week and other requirements (such as having one full day off) are met.\n\nIn this question the resident works 60 hours per week in his residency program and adds a 10\u2010hour external (\u201cmoonlighting\u201d) shift on Saturdays. His combined total is 70 hours per week, which is below the 80\u2010hour weekly cap. (He also has Sundays off.) In many programs, residents are allowed to moonlight for up to 20 hours per week as long as the overall duty hour limit is not exceeded. That is, if a resident\u2019s in\u2010program work averages 60 hours, then up to 20 additional moonlighting hours may be permitted. Since this resident is already moonlighting for 10 hours, he still has \u201ccapacity\u201d to work an additional 10 hours (making his total moonlighting 20 hours per week) while still remaining within the 80\u2010hour limit.\n\nThus, the answer that most accurately reflects the ACGME standards regarding his allowable moonlighting and implications for patient safety is that, provided he does not violate the overall duty\u2010hour limit (or other rest requirements), he may work up to 20 hours of moonlighting per week.\n\nAnswer: D",

Since the resident has already taken on 10 hours of moonlighting, he has the capacity to work an additional 10 hours.

His labs show an elevated total bilirubin (11.3 mg/dL) with an elevated direct (conjugated) bilirubin (7.8 mg/dL). This indicates a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia rather than an unconjugated one.\n\nStep 2: Consider potential underlying conditions. Gilbert syndrome involves a decrease in UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity, which typically leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (not the case here). Carotenemia, which is due to increased beta-carotene intake, causes orange skin discoloration but does not raise bilirubin levels. Chronic hepatitis C (which would be treated with sofosbuvir) causes different findings and would typically include additional liver-related abnormalities. Dubin-Johnson syndrome, however, is characterized by benign conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is associated with a distinctive grossly black liver due to intracellular pigment (hyperpigmentation of the liver).\n\nStep 3: Match with the provided options. Option (C), \"Hyperpigmentation of the liver,\" corresponds with the pathology seen in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, which aligns with the lab findings and clinical picture of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nFinal Answer: C",
