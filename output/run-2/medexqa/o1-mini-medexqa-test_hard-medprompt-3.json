Therefore, this option is close but mentions a 90-degree bend, which is too flexed.\n\n- **Option B:** *15 cm below the armpit.*  \n  This height would place the cane handle too low, causing improper alignment and potentially leading to poor posture and balance issues.\n\n- **Option C:** *At the height of the fingertips when the elbow is fully extended.*  \n  This would make the cane too high, causing the user to hunch their shoulders and strain their arms, leading to discomfort and ineffective support.\n\n- **Option D:** *At the height of the greater trochanter.*  \n  The greater trochanter is part of the hip bone.

No addition of antiglobulin reagent  \nB. Reaction with the control serum  \nC. Excessive centrifugation  \nD. Insufficient washing of cells  \n\n**Step 1: Consider Relevant Information from Examples**\nThe indirect antiglobulin test is used to detect antibodies in a patient's serum that may bind to antigens on red blood cells. A false positive result means the test indicates the presence of antibodies when there are none. Factors that can contribute to false positives typically involve non-specific binding or insufficient removal of unbound substances that might interfere with the test.\n\n**Step 2: Compare and Eliminate Incorrect Choices**\n- **Option A: No addition of antiglobulin reagent**\n  - *Analysis:* Without the antiglobulin reagent, the test cannot detect antibodies, leading to a false negative rather than a false positive.\n  - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.\n\n- **Option B: Reaction with the control serum**\n  - *Analysis:* The control serum is used to validate the test's accuracy. A reaction here indicates a problem with the test setup but doesn't directly cause a false positive in the patient's sample.\n  - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.\n\n- **Option C: Excessive centrifugation**\n  - *Analysis:* Over-centrifugation may damage cells or remove antibodies, potentially leading to false negatives.\n  - *Conclusion:* Incorrect.\n\n- **Option D: Insufficient washing of cells**\n  - *Analysis:* If cells are not washed adequately, unbound antibodies or proteins may remain, causing non-specific agglutination and resulting in a false positive.\n  - *Conclusion:* Correct.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the Final Answer: [D]**\n\n**Answer: D.

Citrobacter freundii**\n  - **Motility**: Motile\n  - **Urea Test**: Urea positive\n  - **Conclusion**: Does not match urea negative.\n\n- **C. Salmonella Typhi**\n  - **Motility**: Motile (but may exhibit reduced motility at 37\u00b0C)\n  - **Urea Test**: Urea negative\n  - **IMViC**: Typically, Salmonella is Indole negative\n  - **Conclusion**: Does not match IMViC ++--.\n\n- **D. Escherichia coli**\n  - **Motility**: Motile\n  - **Urea Test**: Urea negative\n  - **IMViC Tests**:\n    - **Indole**: Positive (++): Yes\n    - **Methyl Red**: Positive (++): Yes\n    - **Voges-Proskauer**: Negative (--): Yes\n    - **Citrate**: Negative (--): Yes\n  - **Conclusion**: Matches all criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Provide the Final Answer**\n\n**Answer:** D.
