This phase involves several coordinated actions to ensure safe and efficient passage of food from the mouth to the esophagus. Specifically:\n\n- **Descent of the soft palate (Option A)** occurs during the oral phase to prevent food from entering the nasal cavity.\n- **Opening of the lower esophageal sphincter (Option B)** is related to the esophageal phase, allowing food to enter the stomach.\n- **Elevation of the hyoid and larynx (Option C)** is a hallmark of the pharyngeal phase, protecting the airway and facilitating the closure of the vocal cords to prevent aspiration.\n- **Opening of the laryngeal vestibule (Option D)** is contrary to what actually happens; instead, the laryngeal vestibule closes to protect the airway during swallowing.\n\nGiven the consistency across all solutions, the most reliable answer is:\n\n**C**",
