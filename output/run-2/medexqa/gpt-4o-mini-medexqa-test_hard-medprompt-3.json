The vocal cords adduct due to the contraction of the extrinsic laryngeal muscles.\n- This statement is partially correct, as the adduction of the vocal cords can involve both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles.

Therefore, this option is likely incorrect.\n\nB. **Increase in bilirubin**: Bilirubin is a product of the breakdown of hemoglobin and is typically stable in urine. However, exposure to light and time can lead to its degradation rather than an increase. Thus, this option is also likely incorrect.\n\nC. **Decrease in odor**: Urine typically develops a stronger odor when left at room temperature due to bacterial growth and the breakdown of urea into ammonia.

This does not match the condition described in the question.\n\n3. **Eliminating incorrect choices**: Based on the analysis:\n   - A (symptomatic aspiration) is incorrect because it involves symptoms.\n   - C (dry swallow) is irrelevant.\n   - D (symptomatic penetration) is also incorrect as it involves symptoms.\n\nThe only option that fits the description of food going below the vocal cords without causing coughing is:\n\nFinal answer: [B]"

Support small group and individualized programs.**  \n     This aligns well with the RTI model, as SLPs often work in small groups or provide individualized support to address specific language and communication needs.\n   \n   - **C. Separate the subjects from the regular curriculum for speech therapy.**  \n     This option suggests removing students from the regular curriculum, which is not consistent with the RTI model's emphasis on integrating interventions within the general education setting.\n   \n   - **D.
