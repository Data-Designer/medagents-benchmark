The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated.

        "ensemble_response": "The answer most frequently given is B.\n\nExplanation: In the normal lac operon system, the lac repressor binds to the operator in the absence of lactose, blocking transcription. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator, thus allowing transcription of the lac genes. However, if a mutation prevents the repressor from binding lactose, the repressor would remain bound to the operator regardless of lactose presence. This would lead to repression (or greatly reduced expression) of the operon under all conditions. Since glucose is low and would usually allow activation through the cAMP-CAP mechanism, the constant repression caused by the mutated repressor overrides this, resulting in little or no expression of the lac operon genes. Among the options provided, option B (\"lack of expression or reduced expression of the lac operon genes under all circumstances\") is the most consistent answer, as indicated by the majority of the solutions.\n\nAnswer: B.",

Hematocrit is 33%. She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. Which of the following is the most important next step in management?",

Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22\u2013 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?",

        "ensemble_response": "The correct answer is D.\n\nExplanation: The patient\u2019s family history \u2013 a brother and an uncle with Duchenne muscular dystrophy \u2013 raises the possibility that her mother is a carrier, and indeed her mother\u2019s elevated creatine kinase supports that notion. However, in the absence of confirmatory genetic analysis on the affected relatives, we cannot definitively determine the patient\u2019s carrier status. Thus, while there is suspicion, the carrier status remains uncertain, making answer D (\"The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain due to lack of genetic analysis on her deceased relatives\") the most correct answer.\n\nSince Solution 1, 3, and 4 all indicate D, and it appears most frequently, the final answer is D.",
