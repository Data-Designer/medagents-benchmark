The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated.

        "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22\u2013 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease? Options: (F) The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her mother's elevated creatine kinase concentration (I) The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation (H) The patient has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD (A) The patient is not a carrier of the DMD as her muscle creatine kinase concentration is within the normal range (C) The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD (E) The patient has a 25% risk of having a child with DMD (B) The patient's mother is a carrier, hence the patient is definitely a carrier too (D) The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain due to lack of genetic analysis on her deceased relatives. (G) The patient's DMD carrier status is certain due to maternal transmission (J) The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration",
