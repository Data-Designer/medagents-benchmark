        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden-onset unilateral vision loss and an orbitofrontal headache with a dilated pupil and a hard ocular globe suggesting a diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Long-term management of angle-closure glaucoma can include acetazolamide.\n\nExamination of the eye in a patient with acute-closure glaucoma will reveal a red eye that is rock-hard and a mid-dilated pupil which is minimally reactive to light. The fundoscopic exam will show an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio (>0.4) and tonometry will show increased intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Acute treatment and long-term management involve the administration of beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide to decrease intraocular pressure. The definitive treatment is iridotomy.\n\nAiraksinen et al. review the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. They discuss how a combination of acetazolamide and beta-blockers can terminate an attack. They recommend using 1 drop of pilocarpine 3 hours after intravenous acetazolamide administration.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing an eye with injected conjunctiva (red circles) and a mid-dilated pupil. These findings are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Amitriptyline can be used as prophylaxis for migraines. Migraines present as unilateral, pulsating headaches that may be associated with nausea or photophobia. Patients with migraines can sometimes experience an aura with visual field changes; however, they would not have exam findings of a rock-hard eye or injection.\n\nAnswer C: Clopidogrel may be used as a conservative treatment for carotid atherosclerosis, which can be an embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO presents as acute, painless, monocular vision loss. A fundoscopic exam will demonstrate ischemia of the retina.\n\nAnswer D: Epinephrine is contraindicated in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma as it increases pupillary dilation. It is used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. This would present with gradually patchy loss of vision and is generally painless.\n\nAnswer E: Verapamil is used as prophylaxis for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches present as unilateral, repetitive, brief headaches associated with severe peri-orbital pain, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPharmacologic management of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",

She presented with similar symptoms 6 weeks ago and was treated for an Escherchia coli infection. She also was treated for a urinary tract infection 10 weeks ago. Her mother says that last night her daughter felt ill, and her condition has been worsening. Her daughter experienced a severe headache and had a stiff neck. This morning she was minimally responsive, vomited several times, and produced a small amount of dark cloudy urine. The patient was born at 39 weeks and met all her developmental milestones.

Typically, this is a parent feigning or creating symptoms in a child in order to receive the psychiatric gain of attention from healthcare personnel.

Gastroenteritis does not best explain the most likely underlying cause of this patient's presentation.\n\nAnswer B: Immunodeficiency such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) would present with lifelong infections from birth that are bacterial, viral, and fungal. Immunodeficiency would not present with repeat infections in a pediatric patient only when they are with one patient.\n\nAnswer D: Meningitis would present with headache, altered mental status, and meningeal signs.

Intentional contamination",
            "Step 1 \u2013 Assess the Clinical History and Family Setting:\n\u2022 The patient is a 9\u2010year-old girl with repeated episodes of infections (a prior Escherichia coli infection and a urinary tract infection) within weeks of one another.\n\u2022 She now presents with signs suggestive of a severe infection (fever, headache, stiff neck, altered mental status, vomiting, hypotension, tachycardia) and abnormal urine.\n\u2022 An important social history detail is that her parents are divorced, and her father notes that she \u201cdoes not seem to get sick\u201d when she is under his care.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Consider the Possibilities:\n\u2022 Gastroenteritis (Option A) is unlikely since her symptoms (stiff neck, altered mental status) are not typical of a primary gastrointestinal problem.\n\u2022 Immunodeficiency (Option B) might explain recurrent infections; however, the girl had no notable infections during early childhood and is up to date on vaccinations, making a primary immunodeficiency less likely.\n\u2022 Meningitis (Option D) could explain her current symptoms, but meningitis would not account for the recurrent, isolated infections (E. coli UTIs) that only seem to occur in a specific setting.\n\u2022 Urinary tract infection (Option E) alone doesn\u2019t explain the severe systemic symptoms, the involvement of neurological signs (headache, stiff neck), or the peculiar pattern of illness appearing only under one caregiver.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Identify the Most Likely Explanation:\n\u2022 The pattern of recurrent infections\u2014especially when they occur in the setting of repeated hospitalizations and only when in one caregiver\u2019s care\u2014raises strong concerns for factitious disorder imposed on another (previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This is a form of abuse where a caregiver intentionally contaminates samples or induces symptoms to garner medical attention.\n\u2022 With the father reporting that the daughter remains healthy in his care, intentional contamination (Option C) by the mother becomes the most plausible explanation.\n\nFinal Answer: C. Intentional contamination",

That raises concern for a difference in the patient\u2019s clinical picture based on her caregiver. In cases of factitious disorder imposed on another (formerly known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy), a caregiver (often a parent) may deliberately induce or fabricate signs of illness in a child. \n\n\u2022 Recurrent infections with E. coli and seemingly bizarre findings (like dark, cloudy urine that doesn\u2019t seem consistent in all settings) make one consider that illness might be artificially induced or contaminated by a caregiver.\n\nNow, reviewing the options:\n\nA. Gastroenteritis \u2013 Doesn\u2019t account for the recurrent UTIs or differing illnesses between caregiver settings.\nB. Immunodeficiency \u2013 Would likely lead to more widespread infections regardless of who is caring for her.\nC. Intentional contamination \u2013 Fits the concern for factitious disorder by proxy, where the caregiver (in this context, likely the mother) is intentionally causing illness.\nD. Meningitis \u2013 While she does have meningitic signs, this does not explain the history of multiple infections and the discrepancy in care settings.\nE. Urinary tract infection \u2013 Again, this doesn\u2019t paint the full picture when considering the repeated episodes and alternate caregiver reports.\n\nGiven the overall pattern and the key clue that she appears well when in the father\u2019s care, the most likely explanation is that someone is intentionally contaminating or inducing illness in her.\n\nFinal answer: C.

The patient\u2019s ECG reveals deep, pathologic Q waves, which in this case are an incidental finding indicative of a previous myocardial infarction or a previous ischemic event.\n\nThe Q wave is a negative deflection just prior to the R wave. Q waves are a normal finding when they are small and are seen on most ECGs. However, pathologic Q waves are indicative of myocardial ischemia. Pathologic Q waves are generally diagnosed when they are >2 mm deep, >1 mm wide, >25% of the QRS complex height, or are seen in leads V1-V3. The interpretation of Q waves depends on other findings on ECG and the patient's symptoms. Deep Q waves in the setting of ST elevation indicate an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, pathologic Q waves found incidentally indicate a previous myocardial infarction or previous ischemic event.\n\nRovai et al. review Q waves. They discuss how Q waves can be used to predict the location and size of a myocardial infarction as correlated with MRI. They recommend testing such as cardiac MRI to assess for previous infarction in the appropriate patient population.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating pathologic Q waves (red arrows). Note the deep and wide Q waves; this raises concern for a past ischemic event.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute myocardial infarctions would present with ST elevation in a vascular distribution on ECG with possible reciprocal depressions. While T wave inversions may be indicative of new or acute ischemia, deep pathologic Q waves without ST elevation are indicative of previous infarction.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia would cause U waves on ECG, which appear as a small, \"second T wave\" after the initial T wave. Note they are not U-shaped despite their name. Management is centered on repletion of potassium and often magnesium as well.\n\nAnswer C: Intermittent torsades de pointes can cause syncope and should be suspected in a patient with syncope in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. This patient\u2019s QT interval is not particularly prolonged, and his syncope seems to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Management is centered on cessation of QT-prolonging medications and magnesium administration. Note that while ondansetron does prolong the QT interval, it is unlikely to cause torsades given the patient took it a week ago.\n\nAnswer E: Pulmonary emboli would present on ECG with sinus tachycardia in addition to pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia. Note that the ECG is a nonspecific test for pulmonary emboli, and CT angiography is the preferred confirmatory test for this condition. Syncope is a possible presentation of larger pulmonary emboli (though the patient would also be hemodynamically unstable).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPathologic Q waves are indicative of a previous myocardial infarction.",

Ondansetron is known to prolong the QT interval, which can predispose patients to torsades de pointes.\n\nStep 2: Consider the ECG findings and the answer options.\n\u2022 Although the actual ECG image (Figure A) isn\u2019t provided, the combination of a history of recent QT-prolonging medication (ondansetron) and syncope suggests an arrhythmia related to QT prolongation.\n\u2022 Option A (Acute myocardial infarction) would typically show ST segment elevations or depressions, not isolated arrhythmia findings.\n\u2022 Option B (Hypokalemia) can cause changes in the ECG (such as U waves) but is less likely in this scenario given the medication history.\n\u2022 Option C (Intermittent torsades des pointes) fits the clinical scenario well, as torsades is a specific arrhythmia associated with QT prolongation, a side effect of ondansetron. Torsades can be transient and lead to syncope.\n\u2022 Option D (Previous myocardial ischemia) is generally characterized by pathological Q waves and changes indicating old infarcts, which does not match the current acute presentation.\n\u2022 Option E (Pulmonary embolism) would typically cause sinus tachycardia and sometimes right heart strain patterns on the ECG, but there is no supporting clinical evidence in this case.\n\nStep 3: Arrive at the final diagnosis.\nGiven the patient\u2019s use of ondansetron, the risk for QT prolongation, and the syncope likely due to a brief arrhythmia, the most likely diagnosis is intermittent torsades de pointes.\n\nFinal Answer: C.

Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding. This stable patient with a benign exam can undergo a CT scan, which will offer more data than a FAST exam and would be performed regardless of whether a FAST exam was positive or negative given this patient's intoxication and abdominal bruising.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn a patient who has experienced blunt abdominal trauma the most appropriate initial step in a stable patient is an abdominal CT scan.",

            "Step 1: Identify the scenario.  \nA 62-year-old man was admitted for an MI, and two days later he develops new chest pain. The repeat ECG (Figure B) in this context is highly suggestive of post\u2013myocardial infarction pericarditis, an inflammatory process that can occur within the first few days after an MI.\n\nStep 2: Narrow the options based on standard management.  \n\u2022 Angiography and stenting are interventions for revascularization during an acute MI or if there is significant reinfarction due to coronary occlusion, but our patient\u2019s presentation fits postinfarction pericarditis rather than a new occlusive event.  \n\u2022 Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that, while used for pericarditis in many settings, is usually avoided post-MI because traditional NSAIDs (other than aspirin) can interfere with myocardial healing and increase the risk of infarct expansion.  \n\u2022 Prednisone (a corticosteroid) is generally avoided as first-line therapy post-MI due to its potential complications with healing and increased risk of myocardial wall rupture.  \n\u2022 Aspirin, especially at high doses, is the treatment of choice for post\u2013myocardial infarction pericarditis because it helps reduce inflammation without the adverse effects on myocardial healing that are seen with other NSAIDs.\n\nStep 3: Final answer.  \nThe most appropriate next step in managing this patient\u2019s underlying condition (post\u2013myocardial infarction pericarditis) is high-dose aspirin.\n\nFinal answer: B.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral cataracts most likely has classic galactosemia. Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk. Patients will also develop bilateral cataracts if the deficit is not detected in the first few weeks after birth. Avoiding galactose by changing to a soy-based formula will avoid the complications of this disorder.\n\nTurck discusses using soy protein for infant feeding. The author notes that there are safety concerns with regards to the high phyto-estrogenic isoflavone content of these formulas. The author recommends that despite these safety concerns, these formulas should still be used in patients with classic galactosemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods would be effective in the treatment of hereditary fructose intolerance. This disease presents similarly to classic galactosemia, but cataracts would not be seen in patients with this disease.\n\nAnswer C: Providing imiglucerase enzyme replacement would be effective in the treatment of patients with Gaucher disease, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, associated findings in this disease would be anemia and avascular necrosis of the bones.\n\nAnswer D: Removing phenylalanine from the maternal diet during pregnancy would be effective in the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria, which can also present with failure to thrive. However, these patients classically present with a \"musty smell\" and eczema.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 supplementation may be effective in mitigating the negative symptoms of homocystinuria. This disease may also present with cataracts or lens dislocations. Associated findings in this disorder would be marfanoid appearance and arachnodactyly.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with classic galactosemia should not be breastfed and should receive a galactose-free and lactose-free diet such as soy-based formulas.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with acute acetaminophen intoxication. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance. This is no longer a preferred method of managing toxicities as patients can aspirate the vomitus or the toxic substance can induce more tissue damage during vomiting.

Acetaminophen toxicity is best managed by reducing absorption if the patient presents within 4 hours of ingestion. Activated charcoal can bind acetaminophen in the GI tract if given early. Blood acetaminophen levels are usually drawn at 4 hours after ingestion since levels before that may underestimate the total absorbed dose.

Yet she states she only took \u201ca few\u201d acetaminophen pills.\n\n\u2022 In suspected acetaminophen overdose, the risk of hepatotoxicity depends on the dose. Guidelines use the acetaminophen level (obtained at least 4 hours post\u2010ingestion) plus nomograms to determine whether N\u2011acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy should be initiated.\n\n\u2022 However, given that she was found with an empty (new) bottle and there is a discrepancy between her account and the family\u2019s observation, it should be assumed that she may have ingested more than the \u201cfew pills.\u201d\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Evaluate the management options:\n\nA. Blood acetaminophen levels \u2013 Obtaining a level is a key step in suspected acetaminophen toxicity. However, the blood level is typically drawn at least 4 hours after ingestion because levels drawn earlier may be falsely low. Since it has only been 3 hours, it would be premature.\n\nB. Activated charcoal \u2013 Activated charcoal reduces gastrointestinal absorption of acetaminophen if given within 4 hours of ingestion. The patient is within that window and appears alert enough to protect her airway.\n\nC. Lactated ringer bolus \u2013 There is no evidence of volume depletion, hypotension, or shock that would warrant fluid bolus therapy in this setting.\n\nD. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) \u2013 While NAC is the antidote in proven significant acetaminophen overdose, it is generally administered once information (via levels) confirms a toxic dose ingestion. Immediate NAC administration might be considered if there were a very high clinical suspicion and the estimated ingestion was clearly toxic, but our patient\u2019s ingestion timing and her current examination make gastric decontamination the priority at this time.\n\nE. Syrup of ipecac \u2013 This is an outdated and no longer recommended method for overdose management.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Choosing the best next step:\n\nBecause the patient is within 4 hours of ingestion and given the discrepancy between her account and her family\u2019s observation, the immediate goal is to limit further absorption of any ingested toxin (in this case, acetaminophen). Activated charcoal is most effective when administered within 4 hours of ingestion and this is the appropriate early intervention. The blood acetaminophen level can be drawn after 4 hours to guide further management with NAC if needed.\n\nFinal Answer: B. Charcoal",

Although administering the antidote, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), is critical in confirmed or high-risk ingestions, it is typically initiated after confirming elevated levels or if the ingestion amount is clearly toxic and the time frame is appropriate.\n\nStep 3: In this case, the patient presented approximately 3 hours post-ingestion and is somnolent though still interactive. Given that the ingestion is within the window where activated charcoal is effective (ideally within 1\u20134 hours), the most appropriate next step is to administer activated charcoal to decrease further gastrointestinal absorption.\n\nThus, the final answer is: B. Charcoal."

The treatment of choice is alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate).\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis results from impaired acid (H+) secretion in the distal nephron. Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis. They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case. The patient's muscle weakness is more suggestive of hypokalemia secondary to type 1 renal tubular acidosis. She does not report symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (joint pain/stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with use).\n\nBullet Summary:\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis is treated with alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate).",

His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy. The authors recommend the use of endoscopic ultrasound in securing the diagnosis in patients with equivocal imaging findings and a high index of suspicion, such as patients with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating calcifications and chronic inflammatory injury (red arrows) suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone is the appropriate management of infectious diarrhea from a bacterial organism. This usually presents with fever, as well as bloody or purulent diarrhea. In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected. This patient\u2019s diarrhea is likely caused by his chronic pancreatitis; thus, oral rehydration may be indicated but does not address the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Rifaximin is an antibiotic that targets gut flora and can decrease enteric flora and treat conditions such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth presents in patients with conditions such as diabetic gastroparesis or scleroderma secondary to decreased bowel motility causing bacterial overgrowth and profuse diarrhea. Treating the underlying cause in addition to rifaximin will eliminate the excess bacteria.\n\nBullet Summary:\nProton pump inhibitors should be given in patients with persistent diarrhea in the setting of chronic pancreatitis to prevent the inactivation of pancreatic enzymes.",

He now presents with chronic abdominal pain and foul\u2010smelling, fatty (Sudan Black\u2013positive) diarrhea. In addition, his serum calcium is low\u2014a finding seen when fat malabsorption causes calcium to bind free fatty acids (\u201csoap formation\u201d) in the gut. In an alcoholic patient with these findings, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen classically shows pancreatic calcifications, indicating chronic pancreatitis; the resulting exocrine insufficiency is responsible for the steatorrhea.\n\nThe definitive treatment for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is supplementation with pancreatic enzymes so that the digestion of fats improves and malabsorption is corrected. Although none of the answer choices specifically list \u201cpancreatic enzyme replacement therapy\u201d (for example, pancrelipase), we must choose the answer that would address the underlying pathophysiology of malabsorption.\n\nLet\u2019s quickly review the options:\n\u2022 Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic used for bacterial infections (e.g. in cholangitis or travelers\u2019 diarrhea).\n\u2022 Loperamide is an antidiarrheal that reduces intestinal motility but does not correct malabsorption.\n\u2022 Oral rehydration addresses dehydration but does not treat the cause.\n\u2022 Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used for acid\u2010related disorders.\n\u2022 Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic used primarily for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and travelers\u2019 diarrhea.\n\nBecause chronic pancreatitis leads to pancreatic enzyme deficiency, the treatment is pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Unfortunately this option is not provided. In exam questions sometimes the \u201cbest\u201d answer is the one that treats the underlying pathology rather than just being a symptomatic measure. Although rifaximin can be used to treat SIBO (a complication sometimes seen in pancreatic insufficiency), it does not correct the exocrine enzyme deficiency itself.\n\nThus, even though none of the provided options perfectly address the root cause (i.e. pancreatic enzyme deficiency), the correct management of chronic pancreatitis\u2013induced steatorrhea is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. In our question, if we were forced to \u201cchoose\u201d from the list given, none of the options would be correct.

His history of significant alcohol use, multiple prior hospitalizations, and a CT scan that (although not shown here) is described in the stem strongly point to chronic pancreatitis. In chronic pancreatitis the continuing inflammation eventually destroys the pancreatic acini, leading to exocrine insufficiency. The resulting inability to properly digest fats produces steatorrhea (foul\u2010smelling, fatty diarrhea) and ultimately fat\u2010soluble vitamin deficiency (which may be partly responsible for his hypocalcemia). \n\nThe underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea is pancreatic enzyme insufficiency secondary to chronic pancreatitis. The optimal treatment for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (eg, pancrelipase given with meals to aid digestion). \n\nAlthough the answer choices provided are:\n\u2003A. Ciprofloxacin\n\u2003B. Loperamide\n\u2003C. Oral rehydration\n\u2003D. Pantoprazole\n\u2003E. Rifaximin\n\nnone of these options represent pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Options A, B, and C are used for infectious causes, symptomatic relief, or supportive care, and while rifaximin (choice E) is an antibiotic used in settings such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, it does not address the malabsorption from pancreatic insufficiency.\n\nThus, the most appropriate treatment for the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. \n\nFinal answer: Pancreatic enzyme supplementation (pancrelipase).",
            "Let\u2019s break down the important points in the case:\n\n\u2022 The patient is a 59\u2010year\u2010old man with a long history (2 years) of abdominal pain and foul\u2010smelling diarrhea. His past alcohol abuse and multiple hospitalizations make chronic pancreatitis very likely.\n\n\u2022 On exam and labs he has a non-tender abdomen, a low serum calcium (7.0 mg/dL), and a positive Sudan Black stain of his stool. A Sudan stain highlights fat in the stool, meaning the patient is having steatorrhea\u2014a classic sign of fat malabsorption.\n\n\u2022 In chronic pancreatitis (especially related to long-term alcohol abuse) the pancreas may become calcified (as seen on the CT scan) and lose its exocrine function. Pancreatic enzyme deficiency leads to malabsorption of fat, which in turn causes steatorrhea. In the gut, unabsorbed fatty acids bind calcium, resulting in hypocalcemia.\n\nThus, the underlying problem is pancreatic exocrine insufficiency from chronic pancreatitis, and the treatment that directly addresses this deficiency is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (e.g., pancrelipase).\n\nNow, let\u2019s review the answer choices given:\n\nA. Ciprofloxacin \u2013 This is an antibiotic, used for bacterial infections such as traveler's diarrhea, but it does not treat malabsorption from pancreatic insufficiency.\nB. Loperamide \u2013 This is an anti-motility agent that only provides symptomatic relief for diarrhea but does not address malabsorption.\nC. Oral rehydration \u2013 While useful in many diarrheal illnesses to prevent dehydration, it does not treat the problem causing steatorrhea.\nD. Pantoprazole \u2013 A proton pump inhibitor used for acid-related disorders; it\u2019s not indicated for malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency.\nE. Rifaximin \u2013 Although used for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and certain cases of diarrhea, it does not treat pancreatic enzyme deficiency.\n\nNone of the provided options directly corresponds to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which is the treatment for chronic pancreatitis\u2010related exocrine insufficiency. Pancreatic enzyme replacement (for example, pancrelipase) is the appropriate treatment to improve fat digestion and correct nutrient malabsorption.\n\nThus, the most appropriate treatment for the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy."

        "final_solution": "We can piece together the clues as follows. This 59\u2010year\u2010old man has a long history of alcohol abuse with multiple hospital admissions. He now presents with chronic abdominal pain and foul\u2010smelling, fatty (Sudan Black\u2013positive) diarrhea. In addition, his serum calcium is low\u2014a finding seen when fat malabsorption causes calcium to bind free fatty acids (\u201csoap formation\u201d) in the gut. In an alcoholic patient with these findings, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen classically shows pancreatic calcifications, indicating chronic pancreatitis; the resulting exocrine insufficiency is responsible for the steatorrhea.\n\nThe definitive treatment for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is supplementation with pancreatic enzymes so that the digestion of fats improves and malabsorption is corrected. Although none of the answer choices specifically list \u201cpancreatic enzyme replacement therapy\u201d (for example, pancrelipase), we must choose the answer that would address the underlying pathophysiology of malabsorption.\n\nLet\u2019s quickly review the options:\n\u2022 Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic used for bacterial infections (e.g. in cholangitis or travelers\u2019 diarrhea).\n\u2022 Loperamide is an antidiarrheal that reduces intestinal motility but does not correct malabsorption.\n\u2022 Oral rehydration addresses dehydration but does not treat the cause.\n\u2022 Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used for acid\u2010related disorders.\n\u2022 Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic used primarily for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and travelers\u2019 diarrhea.\n\nBecause chronic pancreatitis leads to pancreatic enzyme deficiency, the treatment is pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Unfortunately this option is not provided. In exam questions sometimes the \u201cbest\u201d answer is the one that treats the underlying pathology rather than just being a symptomatic measure. Although rifaximin can be used to treat SIBO (a complication sometimes seen in pancreatic insufficiency), it does not correct the exocrine enzyme deficiency itself.\n\nThus, even though none of the provided options perfectly address the root cause (i.e. pancreatic enzyme deficiency), the correct management of chronic pancreatitis\u2013induced steatorrhea is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. In our question, if we were forced to \u201cchoose\u201d from the list given, none of the options would be correct. (That is, the proper treatment is to provide pancreatic enzyme supplementation.)\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nFinal Answer: Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (pancrelipase) \n\nSince this option is not listed, it appears that the answer choices have inadvertently omitted the proper treatment."

Cerebral infarction \u2013 A stroke is less likely here because his symptoms have been progressively worsening over weeks rather than a sudden onset, and the deficits are confined to the arm without other signs of cerebral involvement.\n\nD. Scalenus anticus syndrome \u2013 This form of thoracic outlet syndrome typically provokes symptoms with head and neck movements, which this patient does not report.\n\nE. Subclavian steal syndrome \u2013 This usually causes symptoms related to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (e.g., dizziness, visual changes) in addition to arm symptoms, which is not observed here.\n\nStep 3: Final determination.\nGiven the patient\u2019s heavy smoking history, unexplained weight loss, and unilateral upper extremity symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is an apical lung tumor (Pancoast tumor) compressing the brachial plexus.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Apical lung tumor."

The most appropriate initial step in management is urgent broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical drainage.\n\nCavernous sinus thrombosis is an emergency that requires immediate intervention. It typically occurs in a patient with a history of sinusitis, oral contraceptive pill usage, smoking, or other risk factors that could cause a hypercoagulable state. These patients will often present with severe pain, a sudden headache, and diplopia. A distinct appearance is typically noted with periorbital edema. These patients should be immediately treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and undergo surgical drainage of the inciting source of infection. In some cases, thrombolytics can be used as well.\n\nCaranfa and Yoon review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of septic cavernous sinus thrombosis. They discuss how this diagnosis was almost universally fatal in the pre-antibiotic era. They recommend using broad-spectrum antibiotics and debridement to address this disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph demonstrating a face with swelling and periorbital edema (red circles). This appearance is classically seen in patients with CST.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid would be appropriate management of acute otitis media or sinusitis; however, it is insufficient coverage for CST. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical intervention are needed to prevent loss of vision.\n\nAnswer B: A CT scan of the head could be indicated potentially for surgical planning in a more stable patient; however, in this situation, immediate intervention is more dire. After antibiotics and stabilization, CNS imaging will be needed.\n\nAnswer C: Dexamethasone would be appropriate treatment of a relapse of multiple sclerosis, which can also present with visual changes; however, it would not present with sudden headache and periorbital edema.\n\nAnswer D: An MRI of the brain would be appropriate for further characterizing neurologic deficits of unclear etiology.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with bright red blood per rectum with a non-tender abdomen. Of the answer choices given, angiodysplasia is the most likely to cause such profuse and sudden bleeding.\n\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly in the colon. The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding. Any patient who is unstable or anemic with a hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL requires a transfusion with blood products. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of bright red blood per rectum but is not more common than diverticulosis.\n\nGarcia-Compeon et al. review the presentation and treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. The authors note that angiodysplasias are the cause of many \"occult\" GI bleeds not visualized on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. The authors recommend the use of capsule endoscopy in occult GI bleeds to identify angiodysplasias as a potential source.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Erosion into a gastric vessel is the pathophysiology of a bleeding gastric vessel secondary to peptic ulcer disease. This usually presents with melena (black tarry stools) rather than bright red blood per rectum. Only in cases of extremely brisk upper GI bleeding would patients present with bright red blood per rectum. Treatment involves treating Helicobacter pylori infection if present, proton pump inhibitors, and sucralfate. Endoscopy is needed to confirm and treat the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching is the pathophysiology of diverticulitis which presents with a history of constipation with a fever and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Management involves a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and administration of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or ceftriaxone and metronidazole). Diverticulosis presents with bright red blood and is possible in this patient, but it does not involve inflammation or infection, which defines diverticulitis.\n\nAnswer C: Malignancy or colon cancer can present with bright red blood per rectum, malaise, weight loss, and microcytic anemia. While it is possible in this patient, his age, lack of risk factors for colon cancer, and the sudden onset of his symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.\n\nAnswer D: Submucosal esophageal (Mallory-Weiss) tear presents after profuse vomiting (as in this patient) with bloody vomitus.

Infection can lead to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Treatment of minor infection is with amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, patients suspected of having osteomyelitis should be treated empirically with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and sulbactam) and taken for biopsy/culture to identify the pathogen. Antibiotics can then be narrowed down accordingly. Patients will often require between 4-8 weeks of antibiotic treatment.

The most likely laboratory abnormalities are elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), low sodium, and low potassium.\n\nHeart failure is characterized by the decreased performance of the cardiac ventricles resulting in ventricular dilation. As the ventricles dilate, they release BNP as a marker of stretching of myocardial tissue. BNP levels can therefore serve as a marker of CHF. The kidneys will also have decreased perfusion levels in this disease leading to several key physiologic changes. First, is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which serves to increase perfusion to the kidneys by increasing blood pressure. This system achieves increased blood pressure by maintaining sodium and fluid retention at the expense of decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and decreased hydronium ions (metabolic alkalosis). In addition, ADH is also increased to further increase perfusion, resulting in water retention, hemodilution, and hyponatremia.\n\nMa et al. studied the correlation between BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes. They found that patients with CHF and high levels of BNP had increased rates of cardiovascular complications. They recommend assessing BNP levels in patients who are suspected of having CHF.\n\nFigure A is a chart with changes in brain natriuretic peptide, anti-diuretic hormone, sodium, and potassium that would be seen in various diseases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, and high potassium does not reflect the changes that would be seen in CHF. Though aldosterone serves to retain sodium, it also absorbs water. Thus, hypernatremia would not be seen. This pattern could be seen in patients with heart failure who have high free water losses such as after a burn or in desert environments.\n\nAnswer B: High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the appropriate increase in ADH and subsequent decrease in sodium that would be seen in CHF. Patients who have diabetes insipidus can have low ADH in this setting resulting in loss of free water.\n\nAnswer D: Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the finding of elevated BNP that is classically found in the dilated ventricles of CHF. This pattern would be seen in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH where excessive resorption of free water results in hemodilution.\n\nAnswer E: Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and normal potassium reflect the findings in a healthy patient. This patient most likely has CHF, which would result in increased aldosterone and ADH function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCommon lab findings in heart failure include elevated BNP, elevated ADH, low sodium, and low potassium.",

On exam, he has an extra heart sound after S2 (most consistent with an S3 gallop), bilateral pulmonary crackles, and lower extremity pitting edema. Collectively, these findings point toward congestive heart failure (most likely systolic dysfunction).\n\nStep 2. What lab abnormalities do you expect in heart failure? In chronic systolic heart failure, decreased forward flow leads to \u201cunder\u2010filling\u201d of the arterial circulation and subsequent neurohormonal activation. This in turn causes:\n\u2022 Increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention and often dilutional hyponatremia.\n\u2022 Elevated levels of natriuretic peptides (eg, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]), which are routinely used to help diagnose heart failure.\n\u2022 If renal perfusion is decreased (eg, pre\u2010renal azotemia), one might see elevations in BUN and creatinine (with BUN often disproportionately higher).\n\u2022 Troponins are usually normal in uncomplicated chronic heart failure (unless there is an acute ischemic event).\n\nStep 3. Recognize that the figure \u201cFigure A\u201d (which we assume is provided) lists sets of lab values and the option that best fits the picture of heart failure would be one that shows relatively low serum sodium (reflecting dilution), possibly an elevated BUN with a higher BUN/creatinine ratio, and an increased BNP level.

In CHF, the failing left ventricle leads to a rise in filling pressures and volume overload. As a direct consequence, the ventricles secrete excess natriuretic peptides (such as BNP) in an attempt to relieve the volume overload. In addition, neurohormonal activation in CHF leads to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release, which in turn may result in dilutional hyponatremia. Finally, reduced forward output can compromise renal perfusion, leading to an elevated BUN (with a high BUN-to-creatinine ratio).\n\nThus, the laboratory profile you would expect in this patient would include:\n\u2022 An elevated BNP (or NT-proBNP) level,\n\u2022 A low serum sodium,\n\u2022 An increase in the BUN (and possibly creatinine) secondary to decreased renal perfusion.\n\nComparing the sets of lab values in Figure A, the only option that shows a profile with markedly elevated natriuretic peptides, hyponatremia, and signs of renal hypoperfusion (e.g., an elevated BUN with a relatively preserved creatinine) is Option E.\n\nFinal Answer: [E]",

He was found unconscious in a park. His temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 80/40 mmHg, pulse is 156/min, and respirations are 26/min. Physical exam reveals an obtunded man covered in vomit, with track marks on his arm and several skin abscesses. The patient is given 4 liters of Ringer lactate and intravenous antibiotics. As the fourth liter of fluids is finishing, the patient is noted to have jugular venous distension and an oxygen saturation of 92% on nonrebreather. He is subsequently intubated. An ECG is obtained as seen in Figure A. The patient is started on norepinephrine, and his blood pressure is subsequently found to be 85/44 mmHg.

        "reason": "This patient who uses intravenous drugs with skin abscesses (the likely source of his infection) is hypotensive and tachycardic, with a blood pressure that is not responding to IV fluids; this is concerning for septic shock. Given his persistent hypotension, he should be started on vasopressors of which norepinephrine is first line and epinephrine is second line.\n\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening, systemic bacterial infection that leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Early management is centered on IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and workup to uncover the source. If the patient's blood pressure does not respond to IV fluids (by definition, their blood pressure will not respond to fluids in septic shock), vasopressors should be started with a goal mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. The first line vasopressor is norepinephrine, which can be titrated up for maximal effect. If this vasopressor fails to reach blood pressure goals, then the next vasopressor is either vasopressin or epinephrine (either is acceptable). If the second line vasopressor fails to increase blood pressure, then the third line vasopressor is vasopressin or epinephrine (whichever was not used as the second line pressor). Finally, the fourth line vasopressor for septic shock is phenylephrine.\n\nLevy et al. review sepsis. They update the Surviving Sepsis campaign which gives the most up to date management guidelines of sepsis including adequate fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors. They recommend early antibiotics and resuscitation to minimize morbidity and mortality.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating sinus tachycardia. Note the presence of P waves (red arrows highlighting several examples) that are present throughout all leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardioversion would be appropriate in an unstable patient with unstable vital signs in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to convert the patient to normal sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation would present with an irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves. Cardioversion would not be indicated in sinus tachycardia.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone is a potent glucocorticoid that also has mineralocorticoid properties. While giving an IV steroid may have a permissive effect on blood pressure (via upregulating alpha-1 receptors on the vasculature) there is no reason that this patient would have a low cortisol level (such as in chronic steroid use). Epinephrine is a better answer in this case, though steroids can be considered. Steroids are typically reserved for patients failing at least 2 vasopressors (unless they have a known cortisol-deficient state).\n\nAnswer D: Normal saline is unlikely to benefit this patient as he has already been sufficiently fluid resuscitated. Moreover, it seems the patient may be developing pulmonary edema (hypoxia, jugular venous distension), a sign of fluid overload.\n\nAnswer E: Phenylephrine is the fourth line vasopressor and is an alpha-1 agonist. It is much less potent than norepinephrine and epinephrine, and would not be started in the management of septic shock until the patient has received epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn septic shock, the vasopressors given (in order) are norepinephrine, epinephrine/vasopressin, then phenylephrine.",

            "Let's break down the case:\n\n\u2022 The patient, an IV drug user with a background suggestive of sepsis (skin abscesses, track marks) and altered mental status, initially presents with shock (blood pressure 80/40 mmHg; heart rate 156/min). He receives aggressive fluid resuscitation (4 L of Ringer lactate) and antibiotics.\n\n\u2022 Toward the end of the fourth liter, he develops jugular venous distension and a dip in oxygen saturation (92% on a nonrebreather), prompting intubation. This change is concerning for fluid overload and possibly evolving pulmonary edema, which makes giving more fluids less appealing.\n\n\u2022 After intubation, an ECG is obtained (Figure A, not shown here but provided in the question stem) and the patient is started on norepinephrine for persistent hypotension. Despite norepinephrine administration, his blood pressure remains low (85/44 mmHg).\n\nThe management of septic shock follows initial fluid resuscitation (to optimize preload) followed by vasopressors when hypotension persists. In this case, additional fluids (option D) are contraindicated because of signs of volume overload (JVD). Electrical cardioversion (option A) would be reserved for unstable tachyarrhythmias causing hemodynamic compromise\u2014and the scenario provides no clear evidence that his ECG abnormality (even if it shows a tachyarrhythmia) is the primary cause of his shock, as septic shock is clearly present.\n\nBetween the remaining options, hydrocortisone (option C) is sometimes used in septic shock that is refractory to vasopressors; however, the next reasonable step is to modify or add an additional vasopressor. Phenylephrine (option E) is a pure alpha agonist with no beta-adrenergic activity and is less effective in increasing cardiac output, especially in a patient who already has a high heart rate.\n\nEpinephrine (option B) has both alpha and beta effects. It can provide additional inotropic support (via beta-1) while also increasing systemic vascular resistance (via alpha effects) when norepinephrine alone is insufficient.\n\nThus, in this patient with persistent hypotension despite fluids and norepinephrine, the most appropriate next step is to add epinephrine.\n\nFinal answer: Epinephrine.",

Consider the next therapies for refractory septic shock.\nAmong options for septic shock that remains hypotensive despite fluids and norepinephrine, adjunctive hydrocortisone is often used for patients who are hypotensive despite adequate resuscitation. Hydrocortisone may help overcome relative adrenal insufficiency and improve vasopressor responsiveness in septic shock.\n\nStep 3. Evaluate the answer choices.\nA.

        "reason": "This patient with a history of possible anabolic steroid use (wrestler with acne) who presents with right upper quadrant pain and an enhancing lesion in the liver most likely has a hepatic adenoma. The treatment of hepatic adenomas is surgical removal and discontinuation of precipitating agents.\n\nHepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors that typically arise in the right hepatic lobe. They are typically solitary masses but multiple lesions can be seen in patients with prolonged contraceptive or anabolic steroid use and those who have glycogen storage disorders. Patients present with abdominal pain that is localized in the epigastrium or in the right upper quadrant. Sudden, severe abdominal pain with hypotension suggests rupture of the hepatic adenoma into the peritoneum. The lesions can be confirmed on imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. For hepatic adenomas that are < 5 cm and asymptomatic, simply discontinuing the causative drug and observing are acceptable. Large or symptomatic lesions requiring surgical resection in addition to discontinuation of the offending agent. Because these tumors are highly vascular, failure to resect may result in rupture, hemoperitoneum, and shock. Biopsy is contraindicated to avoid rupturing the mass and causing hemorrhage.\n\nKlompenhouwer et al. studied the current management strategies in patients with hepatocellular adenoma. They found that various molecular groups have been identified allowing for subtyping of these lesions. They recommend performing a CT scan to better characterize these lesions.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT with an enhancing mass with a hypoattenuating fatty component. This is characteristically seen in large hepatic adenomas, which are solitary well-marginated lesions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole would be an effective treatment if this patient had contracted Entamoeba histolytica from contaminated food or water on his recent trip to Mexico. While this amoeba can lead to a liver abscess presenting as a mass on CT, it often also causes abdominal pain and dysentery due to intestinal involvement.\n\nAnswer B: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used for hepatitis C. This patient does have risk factors for hepatitis C (risky sexual behavior and intravenous drug use). Although hepatitis C could lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cause a liver mass, this patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Even if he did have hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatitis C alone without surgical resection or adjuvant therapies would be insufficient.\n\nAnswer C: Follow-up CT in 3 months would be dangerous for this man with a large hepatic adenoma. In the interim, the mass will likely continue to grow if he continues to use anabolic steroids, increasing the risk of rupture. Observation and repeat imaging may be suitable for asymptomatic hepatic lesions that are of uncertain but likely benign etiology.\n\nAnswer D: Biopsying the liver mass is appropriate if malignancy is suspected and there is no concern for hepatic adenoma. If an adenoma is on the differential, biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of rupture and hemorrhage intraoperatively.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHepatic adenomas are benign, vascular liver masses associated with oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids that should be promptly resected if large and symptomatic.",

However, other aspects of his clinical picture (age, physical exam, and especially his significant acne on his face, chest, and back) raise suspicion for another etiology.\n\u2022 In wrestlers or athletes, significant acne may be a clue to anabolic steroid use, which is known to predispose individuals to developing hepatic adenomas.\n\nStep 2: Differential Diagnosis and Further Considerations\n\u2022 Hepatic adenomas are benign tumors that can result from anabolic steroid use. They are particularly concerning when larger than 5 cm due to the increased risk of hemorrhage and malignant transformation.\n\u2022 While risk factors such as IV drug use might raise concerns for viral hepatitis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HCC typically occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease and in older patients.\n\u2022 Given his age and the associated findings (especially his widespread acne, which suggests anabolic steroid use), a hepatic adenoma is more likely.\n\nStep 3: Management Options Evaluation\nOption A: Administer metronidazole \u2013 This antibiotic is not indicated for managing liver masses.\nOption B: Administer sofosbuvir \u2013 This is used for hepatitis C treatment, but there is no direct evidence here that his liver mass is due to hepatitis C infection.\nOption C: Obtain follow-up CT of the abdomen in 3 months \u2013 Although surveillance might be acceptable for smaller or less suspicious lesions, a lesion measuring 6 cm is beyond the threshold where watchful waiting is safe.\nOption D: Perform liver mass biopsy \u2013 The diagnosis of hepatic adenoma is often made radiographically in the appropriate clinical context.

In young athletes (wrestling raises the possibility), exogenous anabolic steroid use can lead to the development of hepatocellular adenomas.\n\nStep 2. Interpret the liver mass. Hepatic adenomas are benign liver tumors that can occur with steroid use. Although benign, adenomas larger than 5 cm carry significant risks of hemorrhage and malignant transformation. While other options might address infections (metronidazole) or treat hepatitis C (sofosbuvir), neither applies directly to the management of a large liver lesion in this context.\n\nStep 3.

        "reason": "This postpartum patient is presenting with hypertension, headache, blurry vision, and abdominal pain, which are concerning for a diagnosis of preeclampsia. The most appropriate initial intervention is magnesium.\n\nPreeclampsia classically presents after 20 weeks gestation (or earlier in the setting of a molar pregnancy) with hypertension and proteinuria. Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed. The most important initial step in management is to administer magnesium which is neuroprotective and also modestly lowers blood pressure. Further care involves blood pressure control and benzodiazepines as needed to abort seizure episodes (though note that if a patient with preeclampsia is having seizures, by definition, they have eclampsia).\n\nAl-Safi et al. discuss preeclampsia and eclampsia. They note that postpartum preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur within the first week after delivery. They recommend that mothers should be educated on what symptoms to look for.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT head may be indicated, in particular, if an intracranial hemorrhage was thought to be the cause of this patient\u2019s headache and vision changes. A subarachnoid hemorrhage would present with the classic \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache with blood in the subarachnoid space on head CT. A CTA may localize a bleeding aneurysm and a lumbar puncture would show an elevated red blood cell count in the CSF. It would not explain this patient\u2019s hypertension and abdominal pain. Note that a CT head is not a CTV which is specific venous imaging.\n\nAnswer B: Labetalol is an appropriate blood pressure medication to give in pregnancy; however, it is more appropriate to first give magnesium as this agent is neuroprotective and is the first-line agent of choice in preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer D: MRV head or a CTV head would be appropriate in the workup of cerebral venous thrombosis which is common in the setting of hypercoagulability (such as in the postpartum period) and presents with headache, blurry vision, and seizures. Note that it would not explain this patient\u2019s profound hypertension. It would be more reasonable to first empirically treat this patient's possible preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer E: Ondansetron and morphine would be appropriate symptomatic management of this patient but would not treat her underlying preeclampsia. It is more appropriate to first treat the life-threatening diagnosis before symptom management. If this patient\u2019s hypertension was thought to be due to pain, then morphine could be helpful.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPreeclampsia can occur in the postpartum period and should be managed with magnesium sulfate.",

            "Step 1: Evaluate the clinical scenario. The patient is a 23-year-old woman who, after an uncomplicated vaginal delivery at 40 weeks, now presents with headache, blurred vision, abdominal pain, and a dangerously high blood pressure reading of 194/104 mmHg. Although she is postpartum and the neonate\u2019s management is fine, her symptoms are concerning for severe preeclampsia, which can manifest even in the postpartum period. The severe hypertension and neurologic symptoms (headache and blurry vision) indicate that prompt blood pressure control is essential to reduce the risk of complications such as stroke.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the answer choices.\n\n\u2022 CT head and MRV head: These imaging studies would be important if there were focal neurological deficits or suspicion of a cerebrovascular accident. However, her neurological exam is unremarkable aside from the symptoms that can be attributed to severely elevated blood pressure.\n\n\u2022 Magnesium: In severe preeclampsia, magnesium sulfate is used for seizure prophylaxis to prevent eclampsia. However, in this case, the most immediate concern is the management of her severely elevated blood pressure to prevent complications like intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n\u2022 Ondansetron and morphine: These medications might help alleviate headache or pain, but they do not address the primary issue of severe hypertension and the potential for end-organ damage.\n\n\u2022 Labetalol: This is a first-line antihypertensive agent used in the management of severe hypertension in the setting of preeclampsia, including postpartum cases. Rapid blood pressure control is key to decreasing the risk of serious complications.\n\nStep 3: Conclude the most appropriate next step.\n\nThe patient\u2019s presentation with severe hypertension and neurological symptoms in the postpartum setting strongly point to severe preeclampsia.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with nasal packing, hypotension, tachycardia, a dark, purpuric rash, and confusion, which are concerning for toxic shock syndrome. The most important initial step in management is to administer clindamycin.\n\nToxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening diagnosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and occurs commonly secondary to retained tampons or nasal packing. Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates. It is a relatively weaker antibiotic and would not be used in a critically ill patient with toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAnswers 4 & 5: Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin represent a powerful broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics that covers gram-positives, gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes (piperacillin-tazobactam) as well as further gram-positive coverage and MRSA (vancomycin). Though this is a potent antibiotic combination, neither of these takes priority over clindamycin given the possible benefit of toxin suppression from clindamycin.

        "reason": "This patient with confusion, dark urine, and peaked T waves on electrocardiogram in the setting of a prolonged time spent down likely has developed rhabdomyolysis with associated hyperkalemia. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",

He recommends immediate administration of IV levothyroxine.\n\nFigure A is an ECG with sinus bradycardia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1, 3, & 4: Thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 levels should certainly be obtained; however, the mortality for myxedema coma is so high that empiric treatment with levothyroxine should be started with clinical suspicion alone prior to confirming the diagnosis with laboratory studies, as a delay in therapy could increase morbidity and mortality. After administration of levothyroxine and initial supportive therapy, the diagnosis can be supported with laboratory studies.\n\nAnswer E: Triiodothyronine or T3 could be appropriate in patients with myxedema coma in severe scenarios where patients do not respond to levothyroxine. In some cases, it may also be given empirically but does not take priority over T4 administration.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn myxedema coma, empiric treatment with levothyroxine is appropriate with a high clinical suspicion for the diagnosis prior to laboratory confirmation.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with dizziness and syncope in the setting of likely dehydration (working in a hot/humid environment without water) and feels better after rehydration, suggesting a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. An ECG is performed and incidentally demonstrates a bifascicular block, which is at high risk of progressing to a complete heart block.\n\nBifascular block is a conduction abnormality in 2 of the 3 fascicles that conduct electricity from atria to ventricles. This leaves conduction to the ventricles via the single remaining fascicle. There are different possibilities that may present on ECG. One possibility is a right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block; the other is a right bundle branch block with a left posterior fascicular block. Note that the pathophysiology of complete heart block is an inability to conduct electricity from the atria to the ventricles. If there is only 1 fascicle left to conduct electricity, the patient would be in complete heart block if this fascicle were to no longer work, which is a common outcome in patients with bifascicular block. Treatment of complete heart block involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nWiberg et al. discuss bifascicular block. They note the possible outcome of a complete heart block. It is recommended to look for this finding on ECG and appropriately workup patients to prevent progression of disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bifascicular block. Note the left axis deviation as suggested by the net upward deflection of the QRS in lead I and net downward deflection in lead II (blue arrows). Then, note the appearance of a right bundle branch block with the RSR pattern in aVR (black arrow) and upward R\u2019 in lead V1 (green arrow). This is a classic pattern for bifascicular block. Contrast this to the other pattern of bifascicular block which would present with a right bundle branch block and right axis deviation (upward QRS in lead II and downward in lead I), which was not seen in this case.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atrial fibrillation may occur secondary to aging, hypertension, or ischemia and presents with an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with an absence of P waves. It may cause complications such as stroke. Management typically involves rate control agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction is a likely outcome in individuals with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, in particular, without proper preventive measures and medical therapy including statins, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors. This patient may be at risk of a myocardial infarction with his hypertension, and his underlying bifascicular block could suggest undiagnosed cardiac ischemia; however, it is more likely this patient progresses to complete heart block in the setting of his bifascicular block.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke is a possible complication of atrial fibrillation. For this reason, most patients with atrial fibrillation are on blood thinners to prevent this complication. It occurs secondary to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium. Patients are often risk stratified prior to starting blood thinners with tools such as CHADS2VASC and HASBLED. Isolated syncope is a rare manifestation of stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Torsades des pointes is a progression from QT prolongation which may occur secondary to genetic conditions, medications, and/or infection. It presents on ECG with QRS complexes that twist in amplitude around the electrical baseline. Treatment involves the administration of magnesium sulfate and, if needed, electrical cardioversion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA bifascicular block can progress to complete heart block.",

        "question": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department following a skiing accident. The patient lost control of his skis and collided with a tree. He lost consciousness for about 30 seconds. When he woke up, he was mildly confused but able to ski down the rest of the mountain. The patient initially denied medical treatment but his wife convinced him to be taken by ambulance to the emergency department for evaluation. The paramedics report that at the scene the patient had a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15. During the ride, he became gradually more somnolent. His medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and a prior transient ischemic attack. His medications include atorvastatin and lisinopril.

        "reason": "This patient presents with a lucid interval followed by worsening somnolence and a biconvex lesion on head CT, which suggests a diagnosis of acute epidural hematoma. Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death. Patients with neurologic findings or those with expanding bleeds require urgent surgical decompression.\n\nDadashi et al. present cases of patients with epidural hematoma from acute trauma. They discuss how patients often sustain these injuries from extreme sports. They recommend being aware of this syndrome so that acute interventions can be taken.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates a biconvex hyperdensity that is limited by suture lines (red circle). This is the typical appearance of an epidural hematoma on head CT.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Damage to the cerebral bridging veins results in a subdural hematoma (SDH). An acute SDH more commonly presents with a gradual increase in headache and confusion rather than the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome presented in this vignette. However, a minority of patients with acute SDH may have a lucid interval followed by progressive neurological decline. SDH would have a crescent-shaped appearance on head CT rather than the biconvex appearance of an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer C: Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries describes a lacunar stroke. Although this patient has 2 risk factors for lacunar stroke (hypertension and smoking), this patient\u2019s head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer D: A ruptured cerebral aneurysm would most likely lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subarachnoid hemorrhage presents as a sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap headache\u201d), confusion or somnolence, nausea and vomiting, and meningismus. Surgical clipping or embolization of the bleeding vessel may be required.\n\nAnswer E: Secondary hemorrhage into a prior area of infarction usually occurs in the setting of a recent embolic stroke. Although this patient has a history of TIA and other risk factors for stroke, his head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma. Treatment is supportive with the control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nBullet Summary:\nEpidural hematomas are caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery as it passes through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone.",

A digital rectal exam may temporarily relieve the obstruction and lead to the expulsion of gas and stool (the \u201csquirt sign\u201d). Abdominal radiography typically demonstrates signs of distal intestinal obstruction such as proximal dilation and an absence of air in the rectum. Contrast enema may reveal a transition zone between the dilated proximal megacolon and the narrow rectosigmoid colon. A biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with surgical removal of the defective segment of the bowel.\n\nKessman reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Hirschsprung disease. She discusses how the diagnosis can be made using a rectal suction biopsy.

An abdominal radiograph may show the extension of the nasogastric tube into an abnormally positioned duodenum and would not show diffuse colonic distension. Treatment is with surgical derotation of the volvulus.\n\nAnswer D: Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and also presents with delayed (> 48 hours) passing of meconium. The distal obstruction in these patients will not be temporarily relieved by a digital rectal exam. Contrast enema will demonstrate microcolon involving the entire large bowel.

        "reason": "This patient presents following a vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery with an ecchymotic swelling of the scalp that crosses the midline, which suggests a diagnosis of caput succedaneum. Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days. Treatment is supportive though patients may occasionally require phototherapy if they develop high levels of bilirubin. Transfusion is indicated if there is significant anemia present (though this is uncommon).\n\nJacob and Hoerter present evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with caput succedaneum. They discuss how this lesion commonly crosses cranial suture lines as well as the midline. They recommend differentiating this disease from more malignant etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage found in neonates, but they usually present with more serious signs of respiratory depression, apnea, or seizures. Patients with a subdural hematoma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Treatment of expanding lesions may require surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage, an uncommon but serious complication of traumatic birth. Like caput succedaneum, subgaleal hemorrhages occur most commonly in newborns delivered via vacuum-assisted delivery, but the swelling in a subgaleal hemorrhage involves the entire scalp. Patients may also present with signs of extensive blood loss and neurological disturbances. Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines. The treatment for these lesions is supportive as most of these lesions resolve spontaneously.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding into the lateral ventricles describes an intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with premature delivery and usually presents with neurological symptoms. Neurologic findings include seizures, apnea, respiratory depression, or asymmetric reflexes. Treatment may involve urgent surgical decompression to prevent herniation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCaput succedaneum is an extracranial injury caused by bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurotica in neonates.",

            "Step 1: The newborn is 9 hours old with a scalp swelling that was not present at birth, and the swelling is confined in size (4x5 cm) and shows no increase in head circumference on serial measurement. Vacuum-assisted deliveries increase the risk of cephalohematomas.\n\nStep 2: Cephalohematomas are subperiosteal hemorrhages (between the periosteum and the skull), usually evident several hours after birth, and they do not cross suture lines nor change head circumference over time. This is in contrast to caput succedaneum, which is an edematous swelling of the scalp that is present at birth, crosses suture lines, and is superficial (located between the scalp and the aponeurosis).\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the best answer is:\n\nC.

Key details in the question include: a newborn girl, 9 hours old, with a 4\u00d75 cm ecchymotic area over the bilateral parietal bones; the swelling was not present at birth and was noted after a vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery. Crucially, serial head circumference measurements remain unchanged over 12 hours.\n\nStep 2. The clinical features point toward a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematomas are subperiosteal hemorrhages that typically appear several hours after delivery, especially following instrumental deliveries (e.g., vacuum-assisted techniques). Because the periosteum is tightly adherent to the skull at the suture lines, these hemorrhages remain confined to the borders of a single cranial bone and do not cross suture lines, which also explains the stable head circumference.\n\nStep 3.

His temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam is notable for dyspnea provoked by walking short distances. Jugular venous distension is noted on exam. The patient\u2019s blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg during inspiration.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a preceding viral illness, dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus (blood pressure drop from 150/85 to 130/70 mmHg during inspiration), an echocardiogram with impaired diastolic filling, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG. This constellation of symptoms is concerning for constrictive pericarditis.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic. In contrast to other types of pericarditis, in constrictive pericarditis, there is impaired diastolic filling and thus impaired cardiac function. There are many possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis including infection, inflammatory conditions, or idiopathic. Patients will present with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, a pericardial friction rub, and positional chest pain (usually worsened by laying back and relieved by leaning forward). Patients may also demonstrate jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, worsening dyspnea, and congestive hepatopathy. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, and an echocardiogram will demonstrate impaired diastolic filling and may demonstrate a thickened pericardium. The diagnosis can be supported with pulsus paradoxus (a drop of blood pressure by > 10 mmHg during inspiration).\n\nWelch reviews constrictive pericarditis. He discusses constrictive pericarditis and how the inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling possibly causing unexplained heart failure. Welch notes making the diagnosis is very challenging and requires meticulous echocardiograph assessment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates diffuse ST elevation (blue arrows) with PR depression (black arrows). This is consistent with pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, in the setting of infection, or in the setting of autoimmune disease and is more likely to occur with a rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid. While pulsus paradoxus would be present in this condition, muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans would be more likely to be seen on ECG. Echocardiography would demonstrate an echogenic rim of fluid around the heart.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction presents with chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, and ST elevation in a vascular distribution. Note that this patient\u2019s ST elevation is diffuse and there is no reciprocal ST depression. Moreover, the pattern of chest pain in myocardial infarction is typically exertional and not positional.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary embolism may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, hemoptysis, a history of hypercoagulability, and recent stasis or surgery (such as this patient\u2019s recent Achilles tendon surgery). It can cause obstructive shock leading to hypotension and tachycardia. Note that right heart strain and sinus tachycardia would be seen on ECG.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents very similarly to restrictive pericarditis. Note that in restrictive cardiomyopathy, patients will also have impaired diastolic filling; however, it is due to a myocardium that will not expand rather than the pericardium impairing filling. It can occur secondary to conditions such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis as well as other chronic inflammatory states. The ECG findings are nonspecific but may include low voltage QRS complexes, ST segment changes, T wave changes, bundle branch blocks, and pathologic Q waves (abnormally deep and wide Q waves). The diagnosis can be supported with an ultrasound demonstrating impaired diastolic filling and possible myocardial speckling if a protein (amyloid) is present and deposited in the myocardial wall. The diagnosis can only definitively be confirmed with a biopsy which is highly invasive.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRestrictive pericarditis presents with chest pain that is positional, pulsus paradoxus, a friction rub, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG.",

Cardiac tamponade \u2013 In tamponade, fluid in the pericardial space impairs ventricular filling in diastole.

Digoxin is an appropriate medication that can both control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation and increase cardiac contractility and potentially improve respiratory symptoms in this decompensated patient with heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation presents on ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. The initial management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate control. If the patient is stable, possible first-line agents include beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem). These agents may reduce cardiac contractility and worsen complications such as pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when the patient is in a decompensated state. If the patient has a reduced ejection fraction and requires rate control, then digoxin is a highly effective medication that blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should immediately be cardioverted.\n\nMoskowitz et. al review the management of atrial fibrillation. They note that in the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metoprolol is commonly used in the intensive care setting, is more successful than amiodarone, and had better rate control when compared to diltiazem.\n\nEhle et. al note that digoxin is approved to control ventricular response in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and is the only oral agent with positive inotropic effects approved for the management of mild to moderate heart failure.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating an irregularly irregular rate/rhythm (note the spacing of the blue arrows indicating the QRS complexes) without P waves, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Figure B is a chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral, hazy interstitial infiltrates, which are concerning for pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and prednisone would be appropriate management of a COPD flare, which presents in a patient with a history of smoking with dyspnea, wheezing, increased work of breathing, and a barrel chest. While this patient\u2019s wheezing may be secondary to his COPD, it is much more likely to be a cardiac wheeze given his chest radiograph findings including pulmonary edema. Treating his atrial fibrillation is more likely to alleviate his pulmonary symptoms. Other treatments in COPD include ipratropium and BiPAP.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem would be an appropriate rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of a COPD flare as it will not impair the mechanism of albuterol (which should be given as a nebulizer in COPD flares). In this patient, further impairing cardiac contractility with a calcium channel blocker may worsen his underlying pulmonary edema (given his reduced ejection fraction).\n\nAnswer D: Intubation would be indicated if this patient\u2019s respiratory status were worsening, including failure to oxygenate, failure to ventilate, or impending respiratory failure. This patient\u2019s respiratory status has improved on BiPAP; thus intubation is not needed.\n\nAnswer E: Metoprolol, like diltiazem, would reduce cardiac contractility and may worsen pulmonary edema, in particular, in a patient with a reduced ejection fraction. It also may cause COPD symptoms to emerge, as beta-2 blockade may cause bronchoconstriction (even though metoprolol is beta-1 selective). It would be indicated as outpatient rate control for a patient with atrial fibrillation who can tolerate a beta-blocker, and is preferred in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, as it reduces mortality.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with a reduced ejection fraction may be optimally managed with digoxin, which blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility.",

            "Step 1: Recognize the patient\u2019s overall presentation. This is a 66\u2010year\u2010old man with multiple cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities (including heart failure with reduced EF, COPD, prior MI, etc.) who presents in acute respiratory distress with hypoxemia and significant tachycardia (pulse 140/min). Although he initially had a low oxygen saturation, beginning BiPAP improved his oxygenation.\n\nStep 2: Review the ECG and chest x-ray findings. Although the images aren\u2019t provided here, the clinical details (high heart rate, history of heart failure, and pulmonary findings) suggest a likely arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, contributing to his decompensation.\n\nStep 3: Analyze management options based on his condition. Option A (albuterol and prednisone) is typically used for COPD exacerbations, but this patient\u2019s main issue now is a tachyarrhythmia (with supportive oxygenation on BiPAP). Option B (digoxin) can sometimes be used for rate control in heart failure; however, its onset is slower and it is less effective in an acute setting with high sympathetic tone. Option C (diltiazem) is contraindicated in patients with systolic heart failure because of its negative inotropic effects. Option D (intubation) is unnecessary given his improved oxygenation on BiPAP.\n\nStep 4: Choose the best next step. Option E (metoprolol) is a beta blocker that is effective for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Even though the patient has COPD, a cardioselective beta blocker like metoprolol is often used cautiously in patients with concurrent heart failure (with reduced EF) if hemodynamically stable. In this scenario, his blood pressure is acceptable, and he is now reasonably oxygenated, making it the most appropriate next step.\n\nFinal Answer: E. Metoprolol",
            "Step 1: Analyze the scenario. This 66\u2010year\u2010old man with a history of heart failure with a severely reduced ejection fraction (22%), COPD, and previous MI now presents with acute respiratory distress. His vital signs reveal a rapid heart rate (140/min) along with hypoxemia that improved with BiPAP. The ECG (Figure A) shows an arrhythmia consistent with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and the chest radiograph (Figure B) suggests pulmonary edema.\n\nStep 2: Consider management priorities. In this patient the immediate goals are to improve oxygenation and to control the rapid heart rate that can worsen heart failure. His oxygenation has improved with BiPAP, so the next step is controlling his rate. However, his low ejection fraction limits our choices for rate control.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate treatment options.\n\n\u2022 Option A (Albuterol and prednisone) is used to treat COPD exacerbations; however, his primary issue now is a rapid heart rate in the setting of heart failure rather than an isolated COPD flare.\n\n\u2022 Option C (Diltiazem) is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that would normally slow the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation, but in patients with reduced ejection fraction it is contraindicated because of its negative inotropic (contractility\u2010reducing) effects.\n\n\u2022 Option D (Intubation) is reserved for patients who are unable to maintain oxygenation despite noninvasive support.

She has a history of chlamydial infection in her 20's and has had 3 urinary tract infections over the past year. The patient has not been sexually active with her husband due to pain with intercourse. She has no other significant medical history and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/70 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. On physical examination, the vulvar skin is pale and atrophic with reduced elasticity and multiple areas of petechiae. The vaginal mucosa also has a loss of rugae and several areas of friable irritation. There is minimal clear vaginal discharge. Urinalysis is normal and fecal occult blood test is negative.

        "reason": "This postmenopausal patient is presenting with vulvovaginal dryness and irritation, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infections, likely due to genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). The most appropriate initial treatment is symptomatic relief with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nReduced estrogen levels after menopause lead to vulvovaginal atrophy by causing reduced blood flow and collagen content in vulvovaginal tissues. Patients typically have thin vulvar skin and loss of vaginal tissue pliability. The bladder and urethral epithelium may also atrophy leading to dysuria and urinary frequency. Atrophic tissue becomes thin, dry, and susceptible to injury. The first line of treatment is vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If this does not improve symptoms, the next step in treatment is vaginal estrogen to help restore blood flow in vulvovaginal tissues. Finally, hormone replacement therapy is indicated if symptoms are refractory to all other modalities.\n\nBhupathiraju et al. studied the association between vaginal estrogen and chronic disease risk. The authors found no association between low-dose vaginal estrogen and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and hip fractures over an 18-year period. The authors recommended that low-dose vaginal estrogen can be used indefinitely without concomitant progestin therapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole is the treatment for trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis. While patients with trichomoniasis can present with cervical petechiae and punctate hemorrhages, they typically also have frothy green discharge (absent in this patient). While patients with bacterial vaginosis can also have vaginal discharge, the discharge is typically malodorous and symptoms of pruritis are generally absent.\n\nAnswer B: Nitrofurantoin is the treatment of choice for urinary tract infections. While this patient has increased urinary frequency and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, her normal urinalysis makes the diagnosis of urinary tract infection unlikely.\n\nAnswer C: Topical clobetasol cream is the treatment for lichen sclerosis. While lichen sclerosis can present with pain with intercourse and vulvar pruritis, patients often have plaques that disrupt the normal vulvar architecture. Lichen sclerosis does not affect the vaginal tissues.\n\nAnswer D: Topical estrogen is the treatment of choice for cases of vulvovaginal atrophy resistant to treatment with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.

        "reason": "This patient's progressively increasing PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex on ECG is consistent with second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, Mobitz type I, also referred to as Wenckebach phenomenon.\n\nSecond degree AV block, Mobitz type I can occur in a variety of settings, such as in the context of digoxin, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or increased vagal tone. On ECG, there is progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex (a dropped beat); then, the PR interval resets. Patients are typically asymptomatic, but should undergo evaluation for an underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia, such as electrolyte imbalances, medication side effect, or structural heart disease, as well as a follow-up ECG to evaluate for any progression. If the dysrhythmia is caused by medication, the offending agent should be discontinued, but otherwise there are no specific treatments necessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic and hemodynamically stable can undergo telemetry monitoring and receive atropine with limited efficacy. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and not responsive to atropine may need cardiac pacing. Generally, there is a low risk of progression to third degree AV block, and a pacemaker is rarely required (in contrast to second degree heart block type II).\n\nBarold and Hayes review second-degree heart block. They note the changes in AV node conduction time on ECG in this condition. They recommend using the correct definition of the different heart blocks for the correct underlying treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG showing PR intervals that gradually prolong until a P wave is seen not followed by a QRS complex (note the blue bars that show the progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until the dropped beat).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: First degree AV block is seen on ECG with prolonged PR intervals greater than 0.2 sec, but a consistent 1:1 ratio of P waves to QRS complexes. This finding is typically found in younger patients with increased vagal tone or in athletes, and does not require treatment.\n\nAnswer C: Second degree AV block, Mobitz type II is seen with fixed PR intervals and occasional dropped QRS complexes. Patients with Mobitz II sometimes present with syncope and frequently progress to third degree AV block. This finding may be associated with fibrotic changes to the conduction system or from acute, subacute, or prior myocardial infarction, and should be treated with placement of a pacemaker in most cases.\n\nAnswer D: Sinus bradycardia findings on ECG include normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Patients with sinus bradycardia may be asymptomatic, but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness, chest pain, or hypotension. No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic, but atropine may be given to increase the heart rate in symptomatic cases. Pacemaker placement is required for patients with chronic symptoms.\n\nAnswer E: Third-degree AV block occurs when the atria and ventricles depolarize independently on ECG. There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. Patients may present with syncope, dizziness, acute heart failure, or hypotension. The treatment is pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSecond degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type I, is characterized by progressively lengthening PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex.",

Treatment for a leukemoid reaction is by addressing the underlying pathology.\n\nPortich and Faulhaber review the evidence regarding the diagnosis of leukemoid reaction. They discuss how the most common cause is infection. They recommend considering paraneoplastic syndromes in patients without evidence of infection.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma presents in a pediatric patient with pallor, fatigue, easy bruising, fever, bone pain, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Treatment is with combination chemotherapy.\n\nAnswer B: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia can present similarly to a leukemoid reaction with non-specific systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy but is a less likely diagnosis in this patient given his age and LAP score. Treatment is with ibrutinib and rituximab as well as other agents.\n\nAnswer C: Chronic myeloid leukemia presents with systemic symptoms, fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and abdominal pain with an elevated leukocyte count (typically > 50,000/mm^3) but a depressed LAP score. Treatment is with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n\nAnswer E: Multiple myeloma presents with systemic symptoms, weight loss, pathologic fractures, and hypercalcemia. It is not associated with an elevated leukocyte score and an elevated LAP score. Treatment is with steroids and chemotherapy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nBoth a leukemoid reaction and chronic myeloid leukemia present with an elevated leukocyte count (> 50,000/mm^3), but an elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score is suggestive of a leukemoid reaction.",

            "Step 1: Analyze the lab findings and clinical presentation. The patient is a 59\u2010year\u2010old man with fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain. His labs reveal a markedly elevated white blood cell count (66,500/mm\u00b3) with a \u201cnormal differential\u201d (suggesting predominance of mature neutrophils) and an elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score.\n\nStep 2: Narrowing the differential.\n\n\u2022 Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a prime consideration in patients with high white blood count, but it is classically associated with a low LAP score due to immature granulocytes with decreased enzyme activity.\n\n\u2022 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) would more characteristically show a lymphocytic predominance rather than a \u201cnormal differential\u201d with neutrophils.\n\n\u2022 Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and multiple myeloma do not fit this presentation.\n\n\u2022 A leukemoid reaction, which is a reactive process (often secondary to infection, inflammation, or stress), is known to produce a high white blood cell count and an elevated LAP score.\n\nStep 3: Choosing the final answer.\nGiven the lab findings\u2014especially the elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase\u2014the most likely diagnosis is a leukemoid reaction rather than a neoplastic process like CML.\n\nFinal Answer: D. Leukemoid reaction",
            "Step 1: Important details include the patient\u2019s age (59 years), his nonspecific constitutional complaints (fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain), and his lab results. Notably, his white blood cell count is markedly elevated at 66,500/mm\u00b3, and his leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is also elevated.\n\nStep 2: In cases of markedly elevated WBC counts, one important consideration is differentiating a primary hematologic malignancy (like chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML) from a reactive process (a leukemoid reaction). In CML, the malignant neutrophils characteristically have a low LAP score. In contrast, in a leukemoid reaction\u2014a reactive process often caused by stress or an infection\u2014the LAP is elevated. The information provided clearly indicates that the LAP is elevated, which goes against a diagnosis of CML.\n\nStep 3: Review of the options:\n\u2022 Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (A) typically presents in children/young adults.\n\u2022 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B) generally shows a lymphocyte-predominant picture.\n\u2022 Chronic myeloid leukemia (C) would have a low LAP, not an elevated one.\n\u2022 Leukemoid reaction (D) is characterized by an extremely elevated WBC count with an elevated LAP score.\n\u2022 Multiple myeloma (E) involves plasma cells and would show different laboratory findings.\n\nGiven the elevated WBC and increased LAP, the best diagnosis is a leukemoid reaction.\n\nFinal Answer: D.

Interpret the Laboratory Values:\n\u2022 In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), one would expect an elevated WBC count with a left-shifted differential and, notably, a low LAP score because the malignant neutrophils have decreased enzyme activity.\n\u2022 Conversely, an elevated LAP is seen in a leukemoid reaction\u2014a reactive process (often in response to infection or stress) that can mimic leukemia.\n\u2022 Other options (such as lymphoproliferative disorders like CLL, or plasma cell disorders such as multiple myeloma, or acute lymphoblastic lymphoma) would have different clinical and laboratory findings that do not match the case.\n\nStep 3. Compare with Incorrect Choices:\n\u2022 A. Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma: Typically presents in children or younger adults with acute symptoms; the lab findings would not demonstrate this pattern.\n\u2022 B. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: While seen in older adults, CLL is characterized by lymphocytosis, and the differential would show a predominance of lymphocytes.\n\u2022 C. Chronic myeloid leukemia: Often presents with high WBC counts, but a critical distinguishing feature is a low LAP score.\n\u2022 E. Multiple myeloma: Primarily associated with bone pain, anemia, and abnormal plasma cells, not markedly elevated WBC counts.\n\nStep 4. Conclude the Most Likely Diagnosis:\nGiven the elevated WBC count with a normal differential and an elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level, the findings are most consistent with a leukemoid reaction\u2014a benign, reactive process rather than a malignant one.\n\nFinal answer: D.

        "reason": "This patient\u2019s new-onset palpitations, irregularly irregular pulse, and absent p-waves on ECG are consistent with atrial fibrillation. In hemodynamically stable patients with a relative contraindication to \u03b2-blockers (COPD on home oxygen with increasing oxygen need), rate control with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil is preferred.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can present with palpitations, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. ECG findings will be an irregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves with an erratic baseline as shown in Illustration A. Treatment is centered on rate control. First-line agents for rate control include \u03b21 selective blockers (metoprolol and esmolol) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem). In patients with COPD, non-selective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol, timolol, and sotalol) can worsen bronchoconstriction by activating \u03b22-adrenoreceptors. Other relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers include Raynaud disease and depression (increased risk of fatigue and sexual dysfunction). In patients with relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred initial treatment option.\n\nVan Gelder et al. studied lenient (resting heart rate < 110 beats per minute) versus strict rate control (resting heart rate < 80 beats per minute) in patients with atrial fibrillation in a randomized control trial. The authors found that there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmias between the 2 groups. The authors recommend a lenient rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG lacking P waves (red arrows) and irregularly irregular RR intervals (red/blue lines), which are classic findings in atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic that can be used in patients to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It is often suitable to use in patients with depressed left ventricular function. Amiodarone has multiple multi-system adverse effects including pulmonary toxicity, and it is not used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer B: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that can be used to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Although patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, the preferred anticoagulation agents are warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban).\n\nAnswer C: Digoxin can be used as a rate control agent in atrial fibrillation as it directly suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction. Due to its narrow therapeutic window and risk of toxicity, it is used as second-line therapy when first-line agents fail.\n\nAnswer D: Metoprolol is a \u03b2-blocker that is a first-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. In patients with contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice. This patient has COPD with increasing oxygen needs making calcium channel blockers possibly a better choice.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn hemodynamically stable patients with atrial fibrillation and relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice.",

The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin. Factor concentrate can also be used to rapidly reverse anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain would be indicated in the workup of a stroke or transient ischemic attack after all emergency interventions and labs including CT head, serum chemistries, CBC, and ECG. It delineates the extent of the stroke and gives useful prognostic and diagnostic information. It also may elucidate strokes missed on other forms of neuroimaging such as CT perfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA fingerstick blood glucose should be obtained immediately in all patients with stroke-like symptoms or altered mental status.",

        "reason": "This patient with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, deviation of the tongue to the right, left-sided hemiparesis, and decreased sensation to light touch and vibration on the left side of his body most likely has a stroke of the right medial medulla. The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation. Treatment includes reperfusion via thrombolytics if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of the time last known well.\n\nKim and Han present clinical findings, radiographic findings, angiographic data, and long-term outcomes from a case series of 86 patients with medial medullary infarction. The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome). This leads to lesions to the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Clinically this presents with dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased gag reflex, vomiting, vertigo, decreased pain and temperature sensation from the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, and ipsilateral ataxia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOcclusion of the anterior spinal artery can lead to medial medullary syndrome, which presents with ipsilateral deviation of the tongue, contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities, and contralateral loss of light touch and vibration sensation.",

In lower motor neuron lesions of the hypoglossal nerve, the tongue deviates toward the side of the lesion.\n\nStep 2: Localize the lesion.\n\u2022 The combination of contralateral body weakness and sensory deficits with ipsilateral tongue deviation is most consistent with a medial medullary syndrome. This syndrome results from damage to the medial part of the medulla.\n\u2022 In medial medullary syndrome, damage to the corticospinal tracts (resulting in contralateral weakness), the medial lemniscus (resulting in contralateral loss of proprioception, light touch, and vibration), and the hypoglossal nerve/nucleus (resulting in ipsilateral tongue weakness) is seen.\n\nStep 3: Identify the artery involved.\n\u2022 The medial medulla is primarily supplied by the anterior spinal artery.\n\u2022 The other options (anterior inferior cerebellar artery, lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery, pontine perforators of the basilar artery, posterior inferior cerebellar artery) do not supply this region.\n\nFinal Answer: B.

Considering that the patient's tongue deviates to the right (indicating a lesion in the right medial medulla) and his left-sided deficits (hemiparesis and diminished dorsal column sensations) are contralateral, this fits the pattern of medial medullary syndrome.\n\nStep 4: Evaluating the options:\n\u2003A.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with chest pain and an ECG demonstrating hyperacute T waves (leads V2-V6) which is an early finding concerning for a myocardial infarction.\n\nA myocardial infarction occurs when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures causing occlusion of a coronary artery. Patients classically present with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Atypical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction may include abdominal pain, nausea, reflux symptoms, and dizziness. The most important initial step in management is to administer aspirin as it lowers mortality and carries minimal risk. An ECG should then be performed. Classically, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will demonstrate ST elevations in a vascular distribution. However, the progression to a STEMI is usually stepwise and may present with ST depressions, hyperacute T waves, pseudonormalization of the ST segment (a normal ST segment after a depression as it elevates), ST elevations, and finally tombstoning (a concave down wave that looks like a tombstone). If a STEMI is suspected after an ECG is performed, the patient should be started on a second antiplatelet agent (e.g., ticagrelor), heparin, and sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\nNable et al. review the typical electrophysiologic changes found in STEMI. The authors note that T-wave inversions and ST-segment depression can before, during, or after the STEMI event. The authors recommend obtaining serial ECGs in patients with suspected STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates hyperacute T waves (blue arrows) that are only occurring in a vascular distribution (V2-V6).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia can present with peaked T waves; however, peaked T waves would be demonstrated in all leads. Other findings of hyperkalemia can include QRS widening. Immediate management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes should include calcium administration followed by drugs that shift potassium intracellularly such as insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate. Further management may include diuresis and/or dialysis.\n\nAnswer B: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may demonstrate increased voltages throughout the ECG, in particular, in leads V2-V6 with deep Q waves in the septal leads. It may present with syncope upon exertion in a young patient (and in rare cases, sudden cardiac death). Ultrasound would show hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Management involves staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activities, and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Hypokalemia can present initially on ECG with U waves and may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias. Repletion with potassium is the preferred treatment, and the magnesium level should be checked as low magnesium can lead to potassium wasting in the kidneys.\n\nAnswer E: Pericarditis presents with chest pain worse by laying back and relieved by leaning forward. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions, and echocardiography may demonstrate a pericardial effusion. Management involves the administration of ibuprofen or colchicine and steroids in refractory cases. However, these therapies should not be used after myocardial infarction.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHyperacute T waves are an early finding that is concerning for myocardial infarction.",

            "We can work through the question step\u2010by\u2010step. The patient is a 27\u2010year\u2010old man with no major complaints who is at his annual checkup. His only medical issues include depression (treated with fluoxetine and lithium). His exam is essentially normal except for a finding depicted in Figure A. Although we don\u2019t have the figure available, when exam questions provide an image along with a list of potential risk factors, the exam image is usually a key finding seen in a classic condition.\n\nLooking at the answer options (alcohol consumption, antibiotic use, illicit IV drug use, poor dental hygiene, and sexual intercourse), many of these are known risk factors for certain infections. Poor dental hygiene and IV drug use are common risk factors for infective endocarditis, which may be associated with peripheral stigmata such as Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, or splinter hemorrhages. However, infective endocarditis usually presents with fever, a heart murmur, and other systemic symptoms \u2013 none of which are suggested in this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nAntibiotic use is a risk factor for conditions like Clostridium difficile colitis, and alcohol consumption is a risk factor for things like pancreatitis or alcoholic liver disease \u2013 again, neither of which match the incidental exam finding described here.\n\nIn contrast, a classic board exam presentation is that of secondary syphilis, which classically presents with a rash that involves the palms and soles. Although the patient is asymptomatic, this kind of rash might be noted incidentally on exam. Among the options provided, sexual intercourse is the most relevant risk factor for syphilis.\n\nThus, by process of elimination and matching the exam finding (presumably a rash involving the palms and soles seen in secondary syphilis) with its risk factor, the answer is:\n\nFinal answer: Sexual intercourse.",
            "Step 1: Analyze the patient presentation. A 27\u2010year\u2010old man with minimal symptoms is seen on a routine checkup. His vitals are essentially normal except for a very low\u2010grade fever. The physical exam is notable for an exam finding illustrated in Figure A. Although the figure is not shown here, its inclusion suggests that there is a classic physical exam stigmata that the attending physician needs to recognize.\n\nStep 2: Reason out the likely finding. Given the context and answer choices, one common exam finding that is often tested is a lesion associated with infective endocarditis\u2014such as Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, splinter hemorrhages, or Roth spots. In a relatively young patient with minimal other complaints, the presence of such a finding may indicate asymptomatic or subacute infective endocarditis.\n\nStep 3: Link the finding to risk factors. Two answer choices (poor dental hygiene and intravenous drug use) are common risk factors for infective endocarditis. In intravenous drug users, Staphylococcus aureus is common and it tends to affect the right side of the heart. In contrast, poor dental hygiene predisposes to transient bacteremia with viridans group streptococci that can seed previously abnormal or even normal valves and leads to the classic picture of subacute bacterial endocarditis. In the absence of a history of IV drug use and given that he is presenting for a routine checkup, poor dental hygiene is the more likely risk factor.\n\nStep 4: Compare and eliminate. \n\u2022 Alcohol consumption (Option A) is more relevant to liver disease rather than endocarditis.\n\u2022 Antibiotic use (Option B) is associated with other conditions such as Clostridioides difficile infection.\n\u2022 Intravenous drug use (Option C) would be highly suggestive if noted in the history, but nothing in the vignette points toward it.\n\u2022 Sexual intercourse (Option E) does not relate to the classic risk factors for infective endocarditis.\n\nStep 5: Final answer.\nThe most likely risk factor for this patient's presenting condition (presumed to be infective endocarditis with physical stigmata such as Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, or splinter hemorrhages) is poor dental hygiene.\n\nFinal Answer: D.

Supportive care is the most appropriate management strategy for patients with viral meningitis.\n\nAseptic (viral) meningitis presents similarly to bacterial meningitis with neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, malaise, and flu-like symptoms. Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose. CSF should be sent for Gram stain and culture to confirm the diagnosis and rule out bacterial meningitis.

It presents as acute onset, painless vision loss, normally in one eye. On fundoscopic exam, classic findings of this disease include venous engorgement, retinal hemorrhage, cotton wool exudates, and edema/swelling of the optic disk can be seen.

However, immediate fluid resuscitation typically begins with isotonic fluids (like 0.9% Normal Saline) to restore intravascular volume and stabilize hemodynamics.\n\u2022 Rapid correction of hypernatremia is not recommended, as it must be addressed gradually to avoid cerebral edema. Thus, starting with isotonic fluid is appropriate, with a plan to adjust to hypotonic solutions later once the patient is hemodynamically stable and further assessment of free water deficit has been made.\n\nStep 3: Compare the Options and Eliminate Incorrect Choices\n\u2022 Option A (50% Normal Saline 50% Dextrose): This is not standard for initial resuscitation, as the addition of dextrose can provide free water too rapidly.\n\u2022 Option B (Dextrose Solution): Provides free water, which would be contraindicated in acute volume depletion and may worsen hypernatremia if not adjusted appropriately.\n\u2022 Option C (Hypotonic Saline): While hypotonic fluids are eventually used to correct hypernatremia, they are not ideal for the initial rapid restoration of intravascular volume in this setting.\n\u2022 Option D (Lactated Ringer): Although isotonic, Normal Saline is generally preferred in the setting of hypernatremia because it does not contain additional electrolytes (like lactate) that might complicate fluid management.\n\u2022 Option E (Normal Saline): This is the optimal choice for initial fluid resuscitation in dehydration associated with heat stroke.

Although the patient is hypernatremic, the first priority is to restore intravascular volume using an isotonic fluid. Normal saline is appropriate for this purpose, as it increases the circulating volume without causing rapid shifts in serum sodium. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, further management can address the hypernatremia gradually with appropriate hypotonic fluids. Candidate solutions 0 and 1 both recommend normal saline for initial resuscitation, while candidate solution 2 suggests hypotonic saline, which is not ideal as a first step due to the risk of rapid sodium correction and potential cerebral edema.

In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin.

        "reason": "Based on the presence of both hemoglobin (Hb) A and S on gel electrophoresis, this patient has sickle cell trait. Episodes of painless hematuria are commonly seen in these patients.\n\nSickle cell trait is a condition that refers to carrying 1 normal and 1 abnormal beta-globin allele. On electrophoresis, this will present as 3 different bands consisting of about 50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin). HbF decreases significantly after the first 6 weeks of life. Individuals with sickle cell trait tend to be asymptomatic and do not have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population. However, they are at higher risk of some conditions. Patients are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous physical activity and may have episodic painless hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis. The hyperosmolar, acidotic, and hypoxic environment of the renal medulla is thought to trigger red cell sickling which results in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. Patients with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. These patients should receive reproductive counseling and use appropriate preventive measures to prevent dehydration during intensive exercise.\n\nHulsizer et al. studied the association between sickle cell trait and common medical conditions using insurance claims data. The authors found that sickle cell trait is associated with increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and retinopathy. The authors recommend further evaluation of these associations using prospective studies derived from clinical data.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows gel electrophoresis with an example of a normal (95-98% HbA and < 2% HbF), sickle cell trait (50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF), and sickle cell anemia (85-95% HbS and 5-15% HbF) patient from left to right.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Diabetes has not been associated with sickle cell trait in the majority of studies.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is a complication of sickle cell anemia. Mechanisms include functional asplenism, reduced tissue perfusion during a sickle crisis, and chronic transfusions with an indwelling catheter. Common infections include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitis. Sickle cell trait is not clearly associated with an increased risk of infection and actually confers some protection against malaria.\n\nAnswer D: Splenectomy from auto-infarction is often seen in sickle cell anemia, but it is rare with sickle cell trait. In sickle cell anemia, splenic sequestration of sickled red blood cells causes infarction, leading to progressive atrophy and functional hyposplenism. Most individuals with sickle cell disease are functionally asplenic by age 2 to 4. The spleen subsequently cannot phagocytose encapsulated organisms properly, which predisposes sickle cell patients to infection.\n\nAnswer E: Stroke is a complication of sickle cell anemia but not sickle cell trait. This is due to the increased viscosity of the blood and reduced deformability of red cells in patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSickle cell trait is associated with episodes of painless hematuria.",

        "reason": "This young, healthy patient is presenting with constant vertigo, ataxia, vomiting, and a head impulse test revealing a corrective saccade, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) exam, which suggests a peripheral etiology of vertigo, most likely vestibular neuritis. As the diagnosis can be made clinically, steroids are the only treatment needed.\n\nDifferentiating peripheral (the vestibular system) versus central (the brain) vertigo is critical in management. Peripheral vertigo is commonly caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Vertigo that is constant is more consistent with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis but could also be a cerebellar stroke. To differentiate, age, risk factors, and onset of symptoms are critical. Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam. They note how it can be used to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo. It is recommended to perform this exam when differentiating central versus peripheral vertigo.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 3: Head imaging such as a CT head or MRI brain is not necessary in patients with a clear peripheral cause of their vertigo/dizziness with a HINTS exam suggesting a peripheral etiology. Clinically, this patient has vestibular neuritis and can be treated accordingly. Imaging would be needed if the patient had an acute cerebellar stroke.\n\nAnswer D: The Epley maneuver is only indicated in cases of benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo, which presents with severe vertigo (with changes in head position) that diminish with time and keeping the head stationary. Note that this patient\u2019s Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative and that his vertigo is constant rather than intermittent or positional.\n\nAnswer E: Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated within 4.5 hours in the setting of an ischemic stroke after a head CT rules out a head bleed, other reversible causes are treated, and assuming there are no contraindications to thrombolytics. Tissue plasminogen activator can be given in posterior circulation strokes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPeripheral causes of vertigo generally do not require head imaging, and causes such as labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis can be treated with steroids.",

            "Step 1: Review the clinical findings. The patient is a 33-year-old man with constant spinning dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, and rightward nystagmus. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative, and the head impulse test shows a corrective saccade, with no skew deviation. These findings point toward a peripheral vestibular lesion rather than a central cause.\n\nStep 2: Differentiate from other conditions. A negative Dix-Hallpike makes benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) unlikely, ruling out the Epley maneuver (Choice B). A positive head impulse test with corrective saccades suggests a peripheral process, making a central lesion (which would prompt imaging such as CT head or MRI brain) less likely. The absence of skew deviation further supports a peripheral cause. Therefore, stroke (which would be managed with tissue plasminogen activator, Choice E) is also unlikely.\n\nStep 3: Determine the most likely diagnosis and appropriate management. The presentation is most consistent with vestibular neuritis, a peripheral vestibular dysfunction. The mainstay of treatment for vestibular neuritis is high-dose corticosteroids (i.e., prednisone), which help reduce inflammation and hasten recovery.\n\nFinal Answer: D. Prednisone",

In peripheral vestibular lesions (such as vestibular neuritis), this test is abnormal. In contrast, central causes (like cerebellar stroke) often have a normal head impulse test.\n\u2022 His age, lack of vascular risk factors, and the exam findings (including an abnormal head impulse test) lean toward a diagnosis of vestibular neuritis, which is a peripheral lesion.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the Management Options\nA. CT head \u2013 Typically performed if a central cause (i.e., stroke) is suspected; however, findings here point to a peripheral cause.\nB.

        "reason": "This patient with confusion, dark urine, and peaked T waves on electrocardiogram in the setting of a prolonged time spent down likely has developed rhabdomyolysis with associated hyperkalemia. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",

            "Step 1 (Gathering clues): The patient was found after a fall, is confused, and complains of generalized pain. Her dipstick shows 4+ blood with dark urine. In such cases, a positive dipstick for blood without corresponding red blood cells on microscopy often suggests the presence of myoglobin in the urine, a finding seen in rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can cause a rapid release of intracellular contents including potassium.\n\nStep 2 (Interpreting the ECG): Although the ECG image (Figure A) is not shown here, the setting strongly suggests that her ECG likely demonstrates changes consistent with hyperkalemia (for example, peaked T waves or other signs). In the context of rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia is a common complication.\n\nStep 3 (Determining the management priorities): When ECG changes due to hyperkalemia are present, the immediate management step is to stabilize the cardiac membrane. This is best achieved by administering calcium (either calcium gluconate or calcium chloride) to antagonize the effects of hyperkalemia on the myocardium. Subsequent management (like shifting potassium intracellularly with insulin and glucose or administering IV fluids to address the myoglobinuria and prevent renal failure) would follow this stabilization. However, the most urgent step in the presence of ECG changes is the administration of calcium gluconate.\n\nStep 4 (Comparing answer options):\n\u2022 Option A (Albuterol and IV fluids): Albuterol can help shift potassium intracellularly, but it is not the first-line therapy when ECG changes are present.\n\u2022 Option B (Calcium gluconate): This is the correct first step in the management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes.\n\u2022 Option C (Insulin, glucose, and IV fluids): Again, helpful for shifting potassium, but not before stabilizing the heart.\n\u2022 Option D (IV fluid resuscitation): Useful for treating rhabdomyolysis, but it does not address the immediate cardiac risk of hyperkalemia.\n\u2022 Option E (Sodium polystyrene sulfonate): Appropriate for removing potassium from the body in the longer term, but not immediately effective.\n\nStep 5 (Conclusion): Since the patient\u2019s ECG (as shown in Figure A) most likely demonstrates hyperkalemia-related changes, the best and most immediate next step in management is the administration of calcium gluconate.\n\nFinal Answer: B.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after a myocardial infarction for a follow-up appointment. The most appropriate next step in management is to start an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as lisinopril.\n\nWhen a patient experiences a myocardial infarction, there are certain medications that the patient should be started on that lower mortality. These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced. Of note, ACE inhibitors also reduce mortality in diabetes by decreasing hyperfiltration damage to the glomeruli.\n\nJering et al. hypothesized that using an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor would improve mortality in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction. They discuss how an ACE inhibitor is the standard of care in patients currently. They recommend performing a randomized controlled trial comparing these treatment modalities.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an ECG with ST elevation (red circles) in leads II, III, and AVF. These ST elevations are indicative of a STEMI.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hydrochlorothiazide can be used to manage this patient's blood pressure; however, this drug does not lower mortality like an ACE inhibitor. In the setting of patients with myocardial infarctions, inhibition of detrimental ventricular remodeling is key for lowering mortality.\n\nAnswer C: Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to reduce blood pressure; however, it does not reduce mortality in patients who have experienced an MI. Calcium channel blockers tend to have few side effects and can be safely started in most patients.\n\nAnswer D: Continuing current medications and scheduling a follow-up appointment misses the opportunity for the patient to be started on a mortality-lowering ACE inhibitor. In patients who are amenable to starting a new medication, an ACE inhibitor should be administered to all patients who have sustained an MI.\n\nAnswer E: Switching to carvedilol would be unnecessary and not likely to benefit this patient as much as adding an ACE inhibitor. Metoprolol is the preferred beta blocker in patients who have sustained an MI. In the absence of idiosyncratic side effects, there is no indication to use another beta blocker.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients who have experienced a myocardial infarction should be discharged on mortality-lowering drugs such as aspirin, beta-blockers, anti-platelet agents, and ACE inhibitors.",

        "reason": "This patient's mood changes and findings concerning for subacute combined degeneration (fall in the dark, impaired proprioception, weakness, and brisk patellar reflexes), and history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery are concerning for vitamin B12 deficiency. Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection. The spirochete leads to disease in the posterior columns (vibration and proprioception sensation). Patients present with sensory ataxia (similar to subacute combined degeneration), lancinating pain (in the limbs, back, or face), and an Argyll-Robertson pupil (impaired pupillary constriction to light but intact pupillary constriction to accommodation).\n\nAnswer C: Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin are seen in patients with major depressive disorder which does not cause sensory ataxia with brisk reflexes.\n\nAnswer E: Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose would result in hypothyroidism, which can present with depressed mood, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Roux-en-Y is an effective means of losing weight, and as the body mass decreases with weight loss, the required dose of levothyroxine is decreased. It would not present with the abnormal neurologic findings seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRoux-en-Y bariatric surgery increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency via reduction of food intake, decreased functional parietal cell count, and reduced absorption of vitamin B12 (which may cause subacute combined degeneration).",

Notably, she underwent a Roux\u2011en\u2011Y gastric bypass 5 years ago. One known complication after this surgery is malabsorption, including that of vitamin B12 due to decreased parietal cell mass and intrinsic factor production.\n\nStep 3: Link the clinical findings. Vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to reduced absorption (due to decreased or dysfunctional parietal cells post\u2011gastric bypass) typically presents with neurologic manifestations such as weakness, gait instability, and hyperreflexia. Additionally, mood disturbances and depression can be associated with B12 deficiency.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.\n\u2022 Option A (Poor iron absorption) could occur post\u2011bypass but primarily leads to anemia and fatigue rather than the neurologic findings seen here.\n\u2022 Option B (Prior Treponema pallidum exposure) would raise concern for neurosyphilis, which is less likely given the patient\u2019s risk factors and clinical context.\n\u2022 Option C (Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin) describes a pathophysiology of depression but does not address the neurologic findings (weakness and brisk reflexes).\n\u2022 Option D (Reduced functional parietal cell count) correlates with vitamin B12 deficiency\u2014a complication likely post\u2011gastric bypass\u2014that can account for both her mood changes and neurologic deficits.\n\u2022 Option E (Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose) could contribute to mood changes in hypothyroidism, but there are no other signs of overt hypothyroidism, and it does not explain the neurologic exam findings.\n\nStep 5: Final answer:\nD.

Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose \u2013 While hypothyroidism can cause mood changes, it is usually associated with slowed reflexes and lethargy rather than hyperreflexia and falls.\n\nStep 3: Final Answer\nThe patient\u2019s history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has likely led to a reduction in functional parietal cell mass. This reduction diminishes intrinsic factor secretion, resulting in vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms (such as weakness and brisk reflexes due to subacute combined degeneration) as well as mood changes. \n\nFinal answer: D.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a pattern of chest pain (pressure and diaphoresis) that is highly concerning for an acute myocardial infarction. This patient initially has ST depressions (in triage) followed by ST segment normalization and possibly hyperacute T waves which raises concern for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring frequent ECGs to determine if a STEMI evolves.\n\nA STEMI presents with crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among many other possible presentations. When a patient presents with symptoms concerning for a STEMI, aspirin should be administered and an ECG should be performed. Early in a myocardial infarction, ST depressions with hyperacute T waves may be present. As the infarction evolves, the T waves may become more acute and the ST segment will begin to elevate. There may be a brief period of pseudonormalization where the ST segment appears to be normal. If the patient appears better, this can be reassuring. However, ongoing chest pain in the setting of these findings raises concern for pseudonormalization of the ST segment (an ST segment that is going to continue to rise). Nitroglycerin can be administered to see if the patient can become chest pain-free, and serial ECGs should be performed to determine if a STEMI is present. If symptoms resolve and the ECG is stable, this is reassuring and medical optimization and an elective catheterization may be performed. If the ECG evolves into a STEMI, then cardiac catheterization is indicated emergently.\n\nDaga et al. discuss STEMI and its workup. They note the ECG manifestations, and the pathophysiology in addition to the appropriate workup of acute coronary syndrome. They recommend aspirin and catheterization in an acute STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an initial ECG with ST depression (blue arrows) followed by pseudonormalization of the ST segment (green arrows) and possibly hyperacute T waves (black arrows), which are concerning for ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac catheterization may be required in this patient; however, if the patient\u2019s chest pain improves or if the troponin is negative, it is unlikely he is having an acute myocardial infarction requiring immediate catheterization. Repeating the ECG will allow for triaging of the patient and will aid in determining if emergency cardiac catheterization is needed.\n\nAnswer B: Chest radiography is appropriate in the workup of chest pain as it can rule out diagnoses such as pneumothorax or may suggest diagnoses such as an aortic dissection (type A) if there is a widened mediastinum. In this patient, the ST segment changes and characteristic history make acute coronary syndrome a more likely diagnosis, and while a chest radiograph should be performed at some point, repeating the ECG is a more dire initial step in management.\n\nAnswer C: CK-MB level could be helpful in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred as it elevates rapidly and also decreases fairly rapidly. This makes it useful when diagnosing a new myocardial infarction after a recent infarction as the troponin may still be elevated from the previous infarction. This patient has no history of recent myocardial infarction, and a repeat ECG is more dire to determine if this patient needs emergent intervention. Of note, the decision for emergent catheterization should not wait on cardiac biomarkers.\n\nAnswer D: Heparin should not be given empirically to patients in chest pain. It does not necessarily decrease mortality but does increase the risk of bleeding. It is often given to patients with an NSTEMI.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPseudonormalization occurs when an ST depression begins to elevate and appears normal in the setting of a myocardial infarction, requiring close monitoring and serial ECGs to ensure that a ST elevation myocardial infarction does not occur.",

In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are often a better initial drug in depression than SSRIs in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSansone and Sansone discuss SNRIs and their uses. They discuss how there are different efficacies and propensities of the different SNRIs. They recommend choosing an appropriate SNRI based on the patient's needs and comorbidities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression in patients who also suffer from other neuropathic pain conditions or conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred. A TCA might be appropriate if the patient had already failed other first-line agents.\n\nAnswer B: Bupropion is a weight-neutral antidepressant that can be used in smoking cessation and patients who are trying to avoid the sexual side effects of SSRIs (anorgasmia). It would not address this patient's diabetic neuropathy, though it could be beneficial for his obesity.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is an SSRI that could be used first-line for major depressive disorder. However, if a patient has a concomitant condition, it is better to choose a single agent that addresses both problems; thus, SNRIs are better first-line medications in this patient with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer D: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that can be used in atypical depression or as a third-line or later agent in the management of depression. This agent can cause a hypertensive crisis in the setting of tyramine consumption, has many medication interactions, and a long washout period. Thus, it is not usually a first or second-line agent.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).",

            "The patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with exertional heat stroke complicated by rhabdomyolysis. His history of running a marathon in very high temperatures, the development of seizures during his presentation, and the dipstick that is \u201cpositive\u201d for red blood cells (which, in the context of rhabdomyolysis, typically indicates myoglobinuria rather than hematuria) strongly point to muscle breakdown.\n\nWhen muscle cells are injured, they release intracellular contents into the circulation. This includes potassium, phosphate, and uric acid. However, one hallmark laboratory finding seen in the acute phase of rhabdomyolysis is hypocalcemia. Calcium tends to deposit within the damaged muscle tissue, leading to low serum calcium levels early in the course; later in recovery, there can be a rebound hypercalcemia when the calcium is mobilized back into circulation.\n\nStep by step reasoning:\n1. The patient has signs of heat stroke (e.g., high temperature, tachycardia) and the positive urine dipstick suggests a myoglobin release from muscle injury.\n2. Rhabdomyolysis due to muscle breakdown releases intracellular potassium (leading to hyperkalemia), phosphate, and uric acid.\n3. However, in the early phase of rhabdomyolysis, calcium is sequestered in the injured muscles, which results in hypocalcemia.\n\nThus, among the options provided (A. Hyperkalemia, B.

            "In this case the patient has developed exertional heat stroke complicated by rhabdomyolysis. When muscle cells break down (as occurs in rhabdomyolysis), they release intracellular contents, including potassium, into the circulation. This typically results in an increase in serum potassium levels and can lead to life\u2010threatening arrhythmias. Additionally, while muscle breakdown can also cause hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and an initial drop in calcium levels (hypocalcemia) due to sequestration in damaged muscle tissue, hyperkalemia is the most characteristic and immediately concerning laboratory abnormality seen in this setting.\n\nStep\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n1. The patient\u2019s hyperthermia, confusion, and seizure in the setting of prolonged strenuous exercise are typical for exertional heat stroke.\n2. The urine dipstick positive for blood without confirmed red blood cells strongly suggests myoglobinuria, a finding consistent with rhabdomyolysis.\n3. In rhabdomyolysis, the destruction of muscle cells causes the release of intracellular potassium, leading to hyperkalemia.\n\nThus, the correct answer is: A. Hyperkalemia.",

A common paraneoplastic syndrome in small cell lung cancer is Lambert-Eaton syndrome which presents with muscle weakness that improves with activity and worsens with rest. Activity improves symptoms due to accumulation of calcium with exercise which allows for acetylcholine release. This occurs secondary to antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels which decrease acetylcholine release. The diagnosis of Lambert Eaton syndrome can be confirmed with electromyography.

They are sometimes still used for depression and neuropathic pain. In overdose, TCAs block sodium channels in the heart and cause a pathognomonic QRS widening. Sodium bicarbonate should be administered until the QRS duration normalizes.

            "Step 1: Recognize the clinical context. The patient is a young woman with bipolar disorder on lithium who was found after a suicide attempt. In the setting of a suspected lithium overdose, lithium toxicity should be high on the differential.\n\nStep 2: Note the history of chronic lower back pain and a pain specialist. This detail is a hint that the patient may also be taking other medications (such as NSAIDs) for pain. NSAIDs are known to decrease lithium excretion by the kidneys and increase lithium serum concentrations, further predisposing a patient to lithium toxicity\u2014especially in an intentional ingestion scenario.\n\nStep 3: Connect the ECG findings. Although the exact details of Figure A aren\u2019t described here, lithium toxicity can cause various ECG abnormalities due to its effects on cellular membranes. The findings may prompt further evaluation for lithium toxicity (the details of the ECG may mimic conduction abnormalities seen in overdose conditions).\n\nStep 4: Consider the common clinical features of lithium toxicity. Early lithium toxicity typically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and progresses to neurological symptoms (confusion, altered mental status, muscle twitching, tremors). With worsening toxicity, patients can develop neuromuscular hyperexcitability and autonomic instability, which classically can include diaphoresis.

Urinary retention",
            "Step 1: Recognize that the patient, with a background of bipolar disorder on lithium, was found after a suicide attempt with an altered mental state. Given these factors, lithium toxicity comes to mind.\n\nStep 2: Lithium toxicity often presents with neurological symptoms (confusion, tremors) as well as autonomic instability. One of the signs you might see during her course is diaphoresis (excessive sweating) as part of the dysautonomia that can occur during an overdose.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the other options:\n\u2022 Jaundice is not a typical feature of lithium toxicity.\n\u2022 Miosis is more associated with opioid overdose, which is not supported by her vital signs.\n\u2022 Urinary retention is more often seen with anticholinergic toxicity.\n\u2022 Wheezing is not characteristic of lithium toxicity.\n\nFinal Answer: Diaphoresis"

Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial. The authors found that patients who received intranasal naloxone needed a second dose of naloxone more frequently compared to patients who received intramuscular naloxone. The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration).

Anal fissures lateral to the midline are associated with inflammatory and infectious etiologies; thus, further workup (testing for HIV, fecal occult blood testing, and sexually transmitted disease testing) is needed rather than merely symptomatic treatment.\n\nAnal fissures present with exquisite pain upon defecation which may lead to fecal retention and constipation. Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient\u2019s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures. They note that while both operative and non-operative interventions may be indicated in the management of an anal fissure after alternative diagnoses have been ruled out, advances in medical management may spare patients sphincter-dividing surgery. They recommend considering all modalities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis followed by an MRI may be the most appropriate testing if a perirectal abscess is suspected. These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation.

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

He was treated appropriately, and after the treatment the immune system markedly improved (CD4 count rising to >400/mm\u00b3, viral load negligible). Now, he presents with fever, malaise, cough with hemoptysis, and a chest radiograph showing new pulmonary nodules and hilar adenopathy in the left upper lobe.\n\nStep 2: Recognize the likely diagnosis.\n\nThis presentation is highly consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In IRIS, as the immune system recovers (due to effective antiretroviral therapy), it mounts an inflammatory response against residual antigens from prior infections (in this case, likely tuberculosis). The new radiographic findings and symptoms are not due to treatment failure but are a consequence of the reconstituted immune response.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the answer choices.\n\nA. Continue current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies \u2013 In TB-associated IRIS, the appropriate management usually is to continue the existing regimen. In most cases, both the anti-retroviral therapy and antimicrobial (or anti-tubercular medications) treatment are continued. In some cases, adjunctive glucocorticoids may be added if the reaction is severe, but discontinuing any ongoing therapy is not recommended.\n\nB. Determine drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection \u2013 There is no evidence of treatment failure or drug resistance; the new symptoms are more consistent with an inflammatory response rather than a new resistant infection.\n\nC.

Obtain a D-dimer level \u2013 This option is irrelevant as there is no clinical suggestion of a thromboembolic event driving his symptoms.\n\nE. Start high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinue antiretroviral therapy \u2013 While corticosteroids can be used adjunctively in severe IRIS, abruptly discontinuing antiretroviral therapy is contraindicated and would likely worsen the overall prognosis.\n\nStep 4: Final Answer\n\nThe most appropriate next step is to continue the current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies, with consideration for adjunctive therapy if the inflammatory response becomes severe.\n\nFinal answer: A.

The skin lesions are described as thick lesions that do not break with pressure (i.e., they are tense), which is a classic presentation for bullous skin conditions.\n\nStep 2: Consider the differential diagnosis of bullous lesions. Pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune blistering condition, typically presents with flaccid blisters that easily rupture (positive Nikolsky sign) and shows a fish-net pattern of IgG deposition between keratinocytes. In contrast, bullous pemphigoid, also autoimmune but mediated by antibodies against hemidesmosomes, presents with tense bullae that are less easily disrupted. Direct immunofluorescence in bullous pemphigoid shows linear IgG deposition along the basement membrane zone.\n\nStep 3: Compare the answer options.  \nA. IgG in a fish-net pattern \u2013 Seen in pemphigus vulgaris, which doesn\u2019t match the presentation.  \nB.

West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data. Therefore, the pathophysiology of West syndrome is more likely CRH-excess mediated rather than due to a deficiency of vitamin B6.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWest syndrome, which may be caused by CRH excess, presents with hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression, and infantile spasms.",

This inelastic eschar acts like a tourniquet as edema develops underneath, leading to increased compartment pressures and potential vascular compromise.\n\u2022 The treatment for bolstering the compromised circulation in this setting is to relieve the constrictive, non-expanding eschar.\n\nStep 3: Compare the management options.\nA. Amputation \u2013 This is an extreme intervention reserved for cases with irreversibly damaged, necrotic tissue that cannot be salvaged. It is not indicated at this stage.\nB. Escharotomy \u2013 This procedure involves making incisions through the eschar to relieve the constrictive pressure. In burns leading to compartment syndrome, an escharotomy is the appropriate first-line treatment.\nC. Fasciotomy \u2013 This is typically reserved for compartment syndrome of non-burn origin. In burn-associated compartment syndrome, escharotomy is performed first, and fasciotomy is only considered if compartment pressures remain critically elevated after escharotomy.\nD. Intravenous fluid infusion based on the Parkland formula \u2013 This is part of the initial burn management (resuscitation) but does not address the compartment syndrome.\nE. Transfer to burn center \u2013 Although transfer may eventually be needed for comprehensive burn care, urgent intervention is required here to restore limb perfusion, and the next step should be definitive management of the compartment syndrome.\n\nStep 4: Determine the final answer.\nGiven the clinical findings and the fact that the compartment syndrome is due to the constrictive nature of a full-thickness burn eschar, the most appropriate next step in management is:\n\nFinal Answer: B.

Given the blurry vision and ataxia in the setting of increased blasts, this patient may be suffering from a hyperviscosity syndrome secondary to a blast crisis, which can be seen in CML.\n\nCML is a neoplastic proliferation of myeloid stem cells. Patients are often asymptomatic and may present with a white blood cell count > 50,000/mm^3. There are many different presentations. The chronic phase presents with < 10% blasts and is often asymptomatic. The accelerated phase has increased blasts, and patients present with fatigue, weight loss, malaise, night sweats, abdominal pain, and hepatosplenomegaly. Finally, the blast phase presents similar to the accelerated phase but with more severe symptoms. The blast phase may evolve into a blast crisis (> 20% blasts) which could cause a hyperviscosity syndrome. Hypervicosity syndrome may require IV fluids and leukapheresis. The most common translocation in CML is the 9;22 translocation which forms the BCR:ABL gene product.\n\nJain et al. review CML.

Other findings include systemic symptoms, malaise, fever, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly.\n\nAnswer B: Acute myelogenous leukemia is a malignancy of myeloblasts and presents in the elderly. Patients will present with fatigue, malaise, weight loss, anorexia, fever, leukocytosis, anemia (causing fatigue), thrombocytopenia (causing bleeding), and neutropenia (leading to life-threatening infections). Auer rods can be seen on peripheral smear.\n\nAnswer C: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a monoclonal proliferation of incompetent mature B cells that occurs in elderly men and is the most common form of leukemia in the west. Patients are often asymptomatic and may have a white blood cell count > 50,000/mm^3. When symptomatic, patients may experience chills, weight loss, and weakness (note these symptoms are nonspecific).

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with constant right upper quadrant pain in the setting of oral contraceptives (OCP) and likely anabolic steroid use, suggesting a diagnosis of a ruptured hepatic adenoma (HA). The pathophysiology of HA is vascular ectasia from exposure to OCPs and androgens.\n\nA hepatic adenoma typically occurs secondary to exposure to OCPs and androgens (anabolic steroids) causing a generalized vascular ectasia. Both of these drugs should be discontinued in patients with hepatic adenoma. Symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Sudden worsening of pain with unstable vitals suggests a ruptured hepatic adenoma. Patients should be managed with fluids and an ultrasound should be performed to support the diagnosis. Additional imaging tests include an abdominal contrast-enhanced CT to better characterize the pathologic anatomy in this disease. The definitive treatment in this disease is surgery in order to remove the hepatic adenoma. In cases of a ruptured hepatic adenomas, patients require transfusion and operative management.\n\nBioulac-Sage et al. present the current data that are available for classifying hepatic adenomas. They discuss how many of these lesions involve alterations of the HNF1A gene, the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and the CTNNB1 gene. They recommend performing molecular analysis in order to better understand which lesions are likely to undergo malignant transformation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ectopic implantation of a blastocyst (ectopic pregnancy) that has ruptured could present similarly to what this patient is experiencing. Symptoms would include lower abdominal pain and unstable vitals. However, this patient's pain is more pronounced in the right upper quadrant and is occurring in the setting of OCP and possible anabolic steroid use.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation of the pancreas represents a diagnosis of pancreatitis. This would present with epigastric pain after a fatty meal or alcohol consumption. Though this patient does drink more than recommended and should be counseled to reduce her consumption, the pain began after exercising at the gym and there are no other symptoms of pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer C: Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein causes Budd-Chiari syndrome, which presents with a non-specific triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly in the setting of a hypercoagulable state (factor V Leiden, polycythemia vera, OCP use, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria). Though this patient has risk factors for this pathology, they do not have any classic symptoms.\n\nAnswer D: Obstruction of the common bile duct with radio-opaque stones would present with colicky right upper quadrant pain in a patient that is \"fat, female, fertile, and forty.\" Though the pain presented in this case is localized to the right upper quadrant, it is not colicky and there is not a positive Murphy sign described. OCP's are a risk factor for cholesterol stones as are rapid weight loss, both of which this patient has. This is a strong possibility on the differential; however, the symptoms presented suggest a diagnosis of ruptured hepatic adenoma given the demographics of the patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA hepatic adenoma presents with right upper quadrant pain in the setting of OCP and/or androgen use and can rupture leading to unstable vitals.",

In particular, anabolic steroid use is associated with disorders such as hepatic adenomas\u2014but importantly, it is also a recognized risk factor for Budd\u2013Chiari syndrome, which is caused by thrombosis of the hepatic veins (i.e. obstruction of venous outflow from the liver). Acute Budd\u2013Chiari syndrome can present with severe RUQ pain, tender hepatomegaly, and signs of circulatory compromise (e.g., hypotension and tachycardia), all of which are present in this patient.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n\u2003A.

Given that he has no other associated injuries, trephination is the only management indicated.\n\nA subungual hematoma occurs after trauma to the finger leading to a collection of blood under the fingernail. Depending on the mechanism, this can be associated with a distal phalanx fracture. Evaluation for a fracture should include a thorough history, exam, and radiography. If there are no other signs of injury including nailbed dislocation or an open fracture, then management requires only trephination (putting a hole in the nail to allow blood to drain) as this alleviates pressure on the nailbed matrix thus preventing possible irreversible damage.\n\nRsoer et al. compare nail bed repair to nail trephination for subungual hematomas in children. The authors find that there was no difference in complications or outcomes between nail bed repair and trephination; however, the cost in the nail trephination group was lower. The authors recommend nail trephination for children with a subungual hematoma and an intact nail and nail margin.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows the physical exam finding of a subungual hematoma with a collection of blood underneath the fingernail bed (green circle).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Excision and histological examination could be appropriate management of melanoma, which may present under the fingernails with a hyperpigmented, irregular skin lesion, or a \u201cbarcode\u201d appearance if it is at the base of the nail. A spontaneous subungual hematoma could be suggestive of melanoma; however, in the setting of trauma, it is a much less likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer B: Fingernail removal should only be performed if there is also nail avulsion or nail fold disruption to allow for inspection of the nail bed and repair of any laceration. Failure to repair a nailbed laceration could lead to permanent deformity of the fingernail when it regrows.\n\nAnswer C: Observation is inappropriate as the accumulation of blood under the nail in a subungual hematoma could lead to ischemia and permanent injury to the nailbed. When a subungual hematoma is present, trephination is indicated.\n\nAnswer D: Operative repair may be necessary for fractures; however, this patient has no fracture and only has a subungual hematoma which can be drained easily.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA subungual hematoma is common after trauma, presents with a collection of blood under the fingernail, and should be treated with trephination.",

If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s blood, semen, or vaginal secretions, immediate prophylaxis is recommended. This category also includes all needlestick exposures. If the healthcare worker\u2019s mucous membrane or nonintact skin comes into contact with an HIV-positive patient\u2019s urine, feces, or bodily secretions, prophylaxis is not recommended. If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects.

The authors recommend that both salpingectomy and salpingotomy are reasonable options for the surgical management of tubal pregnancies.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT of the abdomen and pelvis is useful in determining if there is an intra-abdominal hemorrhage in patients who are hemodynamically stable. Unstable patients should generally not undergo CT.\n\nAnswer C: Methotrexate therapy is an effective treatment option in patients who are hemodynamically stable. with smaller ectopic pregnancies and lower hCG levels.\n\nAnswer D: Repeat beta-hCG in 48 hours is reserved for hemodynamically stable patients with non-diagnostic findings on transvaginal ultrasound. If the beta-hCG level is below the discriminatory zone (beta-hCG level 1,500-2,500 IU/L), then it should be repeated in 48 hours.\n\nAnswer E: Transvaginal ultrasound is reserved for hemodynamically stable patients who are presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding with abdominal/pelvic pain.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients who present with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemodynamic instability are managed with emergent surgical intervention.",

She also uses an intrauterine device, which increases her risk for an ectopic pregnancy when pregnancy occurs.\n\nStep 2: In this setting, the leading concern is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Although she has been started on IV fluids, establishing the diagnosis rapidly is essential. Options such as repeat beta-hCG or methotrexate therapy are appropriate for stable patients whose ectopic pregnancy is unruptured or for cases being monitored. CT is not indicated due to radiation exposure and isn\u2019t necessary for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nStep 3: For a patient in whom a ruptured ectopic is high on the differential, the fastest and most appropriate diagnostic modality is a transvaginal ultrasound.

Evaluating the options:\n\u2003A. CT of the abdomen and pelvis \u2013 Not appropriate as the first-line imaging in suspected ruptured ectopic and would unnecessarily delay definitive treatment.\n\u2003B.

Methotrexate therapy \u2013 Used for stable patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancy and low beta-hCG levels; not appropriate in an unstable, ruptured scenario.\n\u2003D. Repeat beta-hCG in 48 hours \u2013 Valuable in cases of suspected ectopic in a stable patient or uncertain diagnosis; not appropriate for a suspected ruptured ectopic in an unstable patient.\n\u2003E.

        "reason": "This patient presents with episodic epigastric pain and nausea that improves with the consumption of food, which suggests a diagnosis of a duodenal ulcer. Duodenal ulcers are often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a urease-producing organism.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions and defects in the mucosal lining of the small intestines that allow for damage to the underlying tissues. Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori. If the patient tests positive for H. pylori infection, treatment involves triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor. Patients who fail to improve should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\n\nCiociola et al. studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers. They found that about many had confirmed infections. They recommend against empiric treatment without prior confirmation of infection.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Crypt abscesses are found on histology in ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis presents with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients can also experience musculoskeletal pain, uveitis, and dermatologic findings such as erythema nodosum or pyoderma gangrenosum. Treatment may include mesalazine.\n\nAnswer B: A mucosal defect in the stomach is the pathologic description of a gastric ulcer. This patient\u2019s presentation of epigastric pain that improves with the consumption of food is more consistent with an ulcer in the duodenum. Treatment of a gastric ulcer may include proton pump inhibitors.\n\nAnswer C: Noncaseating granulomas are found on histology in Crohn disease. This patient denies any diarrhea (often associated with pain), which is the primary feature of Crohn disease. Other findings include abscesses, fistulas, and strictures. Treatment may include mesalamine and infliximab.\n\nAnswer D: PAS-positive material is found in the lamina propria on small intestinal biopsy in Whipple disease.

He also has nausea and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (positive stool guaiac). His use of NSAIDs (ibuprofen) and his risk factors (smoking, alcohol) add supportive information. The improvement of pain with meals is classic for a duodenal ulcer.\n\nStep 2: Consider the likely diagnosis. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, which is a gram-negative, urease-producing bacterium.

However, the constant pain and dysphagia are less typical for SLE.  \n\u2022 Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) often has esophageal dysmotility leading to swallowing difficulties, but the skin findings in scleroderma are more about skin thickening or tightening rather than a sunburn-like rash.  \n\u2022 Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) has overlapping features of SLE, scleroderma, and polymyositis. It frequently presents with joint pain, myositis (muscle pain), swollen (\u201cpuffy\u201d) hands, and esophageal dysmotility causing swallowing difficulties.  \n\nStep 3: Identify the most useful antibody.  \n\u2022 In diagnosing MCTD, the hallmark laboratory finding is a high titer of anti\u2013ribonucleoprotein (anti-U1-RNP) antibodies.  \n\u2022 Although anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) is commonly positive in many autoimmune diseases, it is too nonspecific.  \n\u2022 Anti-dsDNA is more specific for SLE, and the other choices (anti-IgG Fc region, anti-Ro) are not as fitting with this patient\u2019s overlap of findings.\n\nStep 4: Final Conclusion  \nThe clinical picture of joint pain, muscle pain, puffy hands, and trouble swallowing (esophageal dysmotility) best fits with mixed connective tissue disease, which is most commonly associated with anti\u2013ribonucleoprotein antibodies.\n\nFinal answer: D.

Patients should be worked up and treated as if they have bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CSF findings in aseptic meningitis show an elevated cell count (though typically < 300/mm^3 in contrast to bacterial meningitis), a normal or elevated protein, and a normal glucose.

The most appropriate treatment for these conditions is valproic acid.\n\nAbsence seizures classically present with cessation of motor activity and speech with a blank facial expression and occasionally automatisms such as flickering of the eyelids. They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile. They recommend using valproic acid if there are concurrent seizure conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Carbamazepine would be the appropriate therapy for a partial seizure (tonic or clonic movements in addition to an absence of a post-ictal period) or for trigeminal neuralgia (sudden pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve). It would not address both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nAnswer B: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a useful treatment that helps a patient develop coping strategies and change unhelpful patterns of thought. It could be useful if this girl was having trouble focusing in school for another reason (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder); however, it is not useful in managing seizures.\n\nAnswer C: Ethosuximide is the most appropriate initial therapy for absence seizures. In this patient, she is suffering from both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which could not be treated by ethosuximide alone, in contrast to valproic acid which could treat both conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic that can also be used as a mood stabilizer. It carries the potentially severe side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is not a first-line treatment for absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

He now presents with fever, cough with hemoptysis, and a chest radiograph showing new nodules in the left upper lobe along with hilar adenopathy. In the context of an improving immune system, these findings are consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), particularly TB-associated IRIS. This phenomenon occurs when an improving immune system mounts an inflammatory response against antigens from a pathogen (like Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that was previously contained or partially treated.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate management options. The appropriate management for IRIS involves the continuation of the current antiretroviral therapy and anti-tuberculous treatment. In most cases, treatment is not changed, though steroids may be added if the IRIS is severe. Among the provided answers, the best option is to continue the current management regimen.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Continue current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies",
            "Step 1: Review the patient\u2019s history and current status. The patient is a 31-year-old man with HIV, who initially had a right upper lobe infiltrate and was diagnosed with a pulmonary infection (likely tuberculosis based on his presentation and CD4 count of 40/mm\u00b3). He was started on treatment, and his CD4 count improved significantly with a corresponding drop in HIV viral load, indicating successful immune reconstitution following initiation of antiretroviral therapy.\n\nStep 2: Analyze his current presentation. About four weeks after starting treatment, he now presents with fever, cough, bloody sputum, and new radiographic findings including left upper lobe nodules and hilar adenopathy. These findings, in the context of recent immune recovery, are highly suggestive of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), where the recovering immune system mounts an inflammatory response against residual antigens from the previous infection.\n\nStep 3: Review the management options. In IRIS, the standard management typically involves:\n\u2022 Continuing current antimicrobial therapy (targeting the underlying infection, such as tuberculosis).\n\u2022 Maintaining antiretroviral therapy.\n\u2022 Monitoring the patient\u2019s clinical status.\n\u2022 Supportive care as needed. \n\nThere is no indication for discontinuing antimicrobial or antiretroviral therapy, obtaining a D-dimer (used for suspected thromboembolism), or starting high-dose glucocorticoids while discontinuing antiretrovirals, which may worsen the underlying HIV management.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion. Given this reasoning, the most appropriate step is to continue the current regimen\u2014antiretroviral and antimicrobial therapies\u2014since the findings are consistent with IRIS.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Continue current anti-retroviral treatment, antimicrobial, and anti-tuberculoid therapies"

            "Step 1: Analyze the patient\u2019s clinical presentation. The 57\u2010year\u2010old woman reports a 6\u2010month history of progressive weakness accompanied by fatigue, depressive symptoms, and a 10-pound weight gain. On exam, she has uniformly reduced strength (2/5 in both upper and lower extremities), sparse fine hair, and a rash on her face and arms. These findings suggest a systemic process rather than an isolated muscular or electrolyte abnormality.\n\nStep 2: Review the laboratory results. Aside from a mildly low potassium (3.3 mEq/L), her electrolytes and other serum values are essentially normal. Hypokalemia in itself rarely causes such severe and symmetric weakness unless it is markedly low. Therefore, option B (Hypokalemia) is less likely.\n\nStep 3: Consider inflammatory myopathies. Dermatomyositis (option A) classically presents with proximal muscle weakness and a characteristic rash (such as a heliotrope rash and Gottron papules) but is more often accompanied by muscle enzyme elevations (not provided here) and usually doesn\u2019t cause weight gain or sparse hair. Polymyositis (option E) causes muscle weakness without rash. Inclusion body myositis (option D) generally occurs in older patients and has a more insidious, often asymmetric involvement with characteristic findings on biopsy; however, it typically does not present with a facial/arm rash or the systemic features seen in this patient.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate signs of hypothyroidism. This patient\u2019s weight gain, fatigue, depression, and hair changes are hallmark features of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroid myopathy can result in significant muscle weakness and may be accompanied by a skin rash (dry, coarse skin). The muscle biopsy (Figure A) in the context of hypothyroid myopathy could reveal findings such as type II fiber atrophy or mucinous deposits. In addition, the systemic nature of her symptoms aligns with thyroid dysfunction.\n\nStep 5: Conclude. Given the clinical features and laboratory data, the most plausible explanation for her presentation is hypothyroidism.\n\nFinal Answer: C. Hypothyroidism",
            "Step 1: Key clinical details  \n\u2022 The patient is a 57\u2010year\u2010old woman with a 6\u2010month history of worsening weakness.  \n\u2022 She also reports fatigue, depression, and a 10\u2010pound weight gain.  \n\u2022 On exam, she has significant proximal muscle weakness (2/5 strength), sparse fine hair, and a rash on her face and arms.  \n\u2022 Her laboratory studies are largely within normal limits except for a mildly low potassium level (3.3 mEq/L), which can be explained by other factors (e.g., insulin use shifting potassium intracellularly).  \n\u2022 A muscle biopsy (Figure A) is provided to help clinch the diagnosis.\n\nStep 2: Differential diagnosis review  \n\u2022 Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that typically causes symmetric proximal muscle weakness accompanied by characteristic skin findings (e.g., heliotrope rash on the face and Gottron papules on the arms and hands). The muscle biopsy in dermatomyositis generally displays perifascicular atrophy and evidence of inflammatory changes (often with a perivascular distribution).  \n\u2022 Hypothyroidism can cause myopathy (hypothyroid myopathy) and is associated with weight gain, depressed mood, and hair changes; however, it rarely presents with a rash like the one described.  \n\u2022 Polymyositis presents with symmetric proximal weakness but does not include rash.  \n\u2022 Inclusion body myositis typically affects older adults but often is asymmetric and does not feature a skin rash.  \n\u2022 Hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness but generally results in episodic weakness (periodic paralysis), and would not account for the rash or the chronic course.\n\nStep 3: Reasoning and elimination  \n\u2022 The presence of a rash on her face and arms, along with the muscle biopsy findings, strongly supports an inflammatory myopathy with dermatologic involvement.  \n\u2022 Although some features (weight gain, depressed mood, hair changes) might be seen in hypothyroidism, the rash and biopsy findings are more consistent with dermatomyositis.  \n\u2022 The other options (inclusion body myositis, polymyositis, hypokalemia) do not adequately account for the skin findings.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Dermatomyositis",
            "Step 1 \u2013 Identify Key Clinical Findings:\n\u2022 The patient is a 57\u2010year\u2010old woman with several months of progressive weakness.\n\u2022 She has classic symptoms of hypothyroidism: fatigue, depression, weight gain, and sparse fine hair.\n\u2022 The physical exam reveals significant proximal muscle weakness (2/5 strength) and a rash on her face and arms.\n\u2022 Although the lab work shows mild hypokalemia, the overall picture (especially with the hair changes and weight gain) is not typical for a primary electrolyte abnormality.\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Evaluate the Options:\nA. Dermatomyositis \u2013 Typically presents with proximal muscle weakness along with a heliotrope rash (around the eyes) and Gottron papules over the joints. Although a rash is present, the associated weight gain, depression, and sparse hair are not characteristic of dermatomyositis.\nB. Hypokalemia \u2013 While hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness, it does not explain the rash, weight gain, or hair loss.\nC. Hypothyroidism \u2013 Commonly results in proximal muscle weakness (thyroid myopathy), weight gain, depression, and fine, sparse hair. This fits the patient\u2019s overall clinical picture, including her recent illness and possible medication exposure, which can sometimes unmask or exacerbate a thyroid issue.\nD. Inclusion Body Myositis \u2013 Usually seen in older men with a slowly progressive course affecting both proximal and distal muscles, but without the thyroid-related systemic features (weight gain, depression, hair changes).\nE. Polymyositis \u2013 Involves symmetric proximal muscle weakness without a rash, and typically lacks the systemic stigmata (weight gain, sparse hair) seen in hypothyroidism.\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Conclusion:\nGiven the constellation of symptoms (progressive weakness, weight gain, depression, sparse fine hair) along with the muscle biopsy findings that are consistent with a myopathy, the most likely explanation is an endocrine abnormality, specifically hypothyroidism.\n\nFinal Answer: C.

It is more common in young patients who are active (e.g. marathon runners). The classic conventional radiographic finding in cecal volvulus is the coffee bean sign, in which closed loops of intestine distend with gas, making visible the medial and lateral walls of dilated bowel. Diagnosis of cecal volvulus can be confirmed with a CT scan. Management involves analgesia, intravenous fluids, and surgical detorsion.\n\nHasbahceci et al. review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of cecal volvulus.

Treatment involves the placement of a rectal tube to decompress the intestines and treatment of any underlying medical conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Sigmoid volvulus is more common in elderly and critically ill patients and presents with constipation, an absence of bowel movements, and a distended, tympanitic abdomen. Although the coffee bean sign may also be seen in patients with sigmoid volvulus, patients tend to be older. In addition, plain radiography typically demonstrates multiple air-fluid levels in a sigmoid volvulus versus usually only a single air-fluid level in a cecal volvulus.

His exam shows a distended, tender abdomen and his vital signs include tachycardia. A plain abdominal radiograph (Figure A) is provided.\n\nStep 2: Narrow down the options by considering both clinical context and typical imaging findings.\n\n\u2022 Ileus \u2013 Usually seen after recent surgery or in hospitalized patients; it causes diffuse bowel distension without a clear transition point. Our young patient has no such history.\n\u2022 Ogilvie syndrome \u2013 This is an acute colonic pseudoobstruction seen typically in older or critically ill individuals.\n\u2022 Sigmoid volvulus \u2013 Although it is the most common type of colonic volvulus overall, it is most often encountered in elderly patients with chronic constipation. It classically produces a \u201ccoffee-bean\u201d sign typically located in the left lower quadrant.\n\u2022 Small bowel obstruction \u2013 Often presents with colicky pain, vomiting, and distended bowel loops on imaging. In a young patient with no prior surgical history or hernias, adhesions (the most common cause in adults) are less likely.\n\u2022 Cecal volvulus \u2013 Occurs when a mobile cecum twists on its mesentery. It tends to present in younger individuals than sigmoid volvulus. Radiographically, one may see a distended loop of bowel (sometimes described as a \u201ccoffee-bean\u201d or \u201ckidney-shaped\u201d mass) typically in the right side of the abdomen.\n\nStep 3: Compare and eliminate. Given that our patient is a young, otherwise healthy man and the radiograph (Figure A) \u2013 though not shown here \u2013 most likely demonstrates findings compatible with a localized colonic twist rather than diffuse small bowel dilation, the most fitting diagnosis is a colonic volvulus. Between sigmoid and cecal volvulus, his age and scenario point more toward cecal volvulus.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Cecal volvulus",

The increased PTH results in renal phosphate wasting, increased production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and increased renal calcium reabsorption.

Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular node dysfunction.\n\nSecond degree heart block can be divided into Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2 patterns. The Mobitz type 1 pattern is usually a result of dysfunction at the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the Mobitz type 2 pattern is usually caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. In Mobitz type 1 2nd-degree heart block, the PR interval becomes progressively longer with each beat before the dropped QRS complex. In Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block, the PR intervals are consistent in length and the dropped QRS complexes occur at regular intervals. The easiest way to determine whether the PR interval is getting longer is to compare the PR interval just before the dropped beat to the PR interval immediately following the dropped beat. Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block. They discuss how a type 1 2nd-degree heart block is caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. They recommend symptomatic treatment of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG that demonstrates the progressive prolongation of the PR interval (blue lines) until a beat is dropped. This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia. Sinoatrial node dysfunction can be treated with pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped QRS complex and is usually caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node.",

            "Step 1: The patient is a 68\u2010year\u2010old woman with a history of myocardial infarction who now complains of dizziness and near syncope. On exam, she has an irregular heartbeat and an ECG (Figure A) that is consistent with an irregularly irregular rhythm. This presentation is most consistent with atrial fibrillation.\n\nStep 2: In atrial fibrillation, the normal pacemaker\u2014the sinoatrial (SA) node\u2014is no longer the sole driver of electrical activity. Instead, chaotic, disorganized electrical impulses originate from multiple atrial foci (often near the pulmonary veins) that \u201coverdrive\u201d the SA node. Although the underlying problem is due to atrial electrical disarray rather than a problem with the conduction system structures that transmit a normal impulse (like the atrioventricular [AV] node, Bundle of His, bundle branches, or Purkinje fibers), the component that normally sets the regular pace is the SA node. When the SA node\u2019s role is lost or overridden, the result is an irregular heart rhythm.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the options:\n\u2022 A. Atrioventricular node \u2013 Primarily acts as a gatekeeper to filter atrial impulses; its dysfunction usually leads to block or conduction delay, not an irregularly irregular rhythm.\n\u2022 B. Bundle branches \u2013 Their involvement typically causes bundle branch block with widened QRS complexes but a regular rhythm.\n\u2022 C. Bundle of His \u2013 Similarly, problems here cause conduction delays or blocks, leading to predictable rhythm alterations.\n\u2022 D. Purkinje fibers \u2013 Their malfunction produces conduction delays but not the chaotic conduction seen in atrial fibrillation.\n\u2022 E. Sinoatrial node \u2013 This is the natural pacemaker that is overridden in atrial fibrillation. The loss of its coordinated pacing leads to an irregularly irregular ventricular response.\n\nStep 4: Final Answer:\nE: Sinoatrial node\n\nThus, the most likely affected component in this patient\u2019s presentation is the sinoatrial node.",

Notably, her irregular heartbeat on exam, in conjunction with an ECG demonstrating an irregular rhythm (as shown in Figure A), points toward an arrhythmia. The \u201cirregularly irregular\u201d rhythm is characteristic of atrial fibrillation, which involves chaotic atrial electrical activity.\n\nStep 2: Relate the arrhythmia to the conduction system. Normally, the sinoatrial (SA) node acts as the primary pacemaker, establishing a regular heart rhythm. In atrial fibrillation, the electrical impulses become disorganized in the atria, overriding the normal role of the SA node.

The 68\u2010year\u2010old woman reports dizziness and near-syncope with an irregular heartbeat on exam despite a blood pressure and heart rate that are not drastically abnormal.

The fact that her ECG (Figure A) shows an irregular rhythm\u2014most likely an \u201cirregularly irregular\u201d pattern with no discernible P waves\u2014is highly suggestive of atrial fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, while the atria are firing chaotically, the primary pacemaker (the sinoatrial node) is \u201coverridden\u201d by multiple ectopic foci. Additionally, ischemic damage (as may occur after an MI) can impair the normal function of the sinoatrial node.\n\nStep 3: Compare the conduction system components:\n\u2022 Atrioventricular node \u2013 A key relay for electrical signals but its dysfunction generally leads to blockages or abnormal conduction delays rather than an irregularly irregular rhythm.\n\u2022 Bundle branches, Bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers \u2013 Their dysfunction typically causes bundle branch blocks or ventricular conduction delays, which are not characteristics of an irregular rhythm like that seen in atrial fibrillation.\n\u2022 Sinoatrial node \u2013 The primary pacemaker of the heart; when its function is disrupted, it can lead to arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, which presents as an irregular heartbeat accompanied by symptoms like dizziness.\n\nStep 4: Final decision. Given the patient's history, presentation, and the typical features of the ECG findings, the component of the cardiac conduction system most likely affected is the Sinoatrial node.\n\nFinal answer: E.

The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole. Treatment is by meticulous control of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology such as hypertension.\n\nKino et al studied the relationship between the S1 and S4 heart sounds in aging patients. They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber. Treatment is with diuresis and treatment of the underlying heart failure.\n\nAnswer D: A holosystolic murmur heard at the apex describes mitral valve regurgitation. This would be possible if a papillary muscle had ruptured in an acute myocardial infarction. Treatment is with mitral valve replacement in symptomatic patients.\n\nAnswer E: A normal S1 and S2 is possible but is less likely given this patient's long-standing history of poorly managed hypertension. Hypertension usually causes concentric hypertrophy of the ventricle and thereby leads to increased resistance to diastolic filling.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAn S4 heart sound is created by blood entering a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle and is often heard in patients with long-standing hypertension.",

It can be caused by antigens, medications, and trauma or may occur spontaneously. It often presents with notable edema of the lips and tongue and may threaten the airway. There are 3 subtypes. Hereditary and acquired angioedema occur secondary to a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. As a result, the most effective therapy is to administer fresh frozen plasma which has C1-esterase inhibitor. On the other hand, drug-induced angioedema (often from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) does not respond well to C1-esterase inhibitor replacement and supportive therapy; discontinuing the offending agent is the mainstay of therapy.

They found that using this medication as an adjunct to sleep hygiene was effective in improving symptoms. They recommend using multimodal therapy for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ethosuximide is the treatment of choice for absence seizures. Though this patient does have episodes of blank staring, this likely does not represent a seizure as he is arousable to return to work by his boss. Patients with absence seizures typically present in childhood and are unable to be aroused during seizure episodes.\n\nAnswer B: Polysomnography or a sleep study would be indicated after sleep hygiene practices have failed. Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if there was a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or an unknown cause of this patient's fatigue. Patients with sleep apnea typically snore and this disease is associated with obesity and increasing age.\n\nAnswer D: Modafinil is a treatment for narcolepsy. Though this patient does have sudden episodes of falling asleep while at work, this is more likely to be related to his sleep schedule. Patients with narcolepsy generally do not feel tired immediately before their episodes of sleep.\n\nAnswer E: Zolpidem is a muscle relaxant and hypnotic with the mechanism of action of a benzodiazepine. Though a drug like zolpidem could be used to help this patient fall asleep, the most appropriate first step is to address the patient's sleep hygiene prior to prescribing a potentially addictive drug.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, and sleep hygiene.",

            "Step 1: Analyze the patient\u2019s history. The 25\u2010year\u2010old man reports chronic difficulty falling asleep at a \u201cnormal\u201d bedtime. He has been attempting to correct this by going to bed earlier, but he only manages to fall asleep about 2 hours prior to his required wake-up time. This results in daytime sleepiness severe enough to interfere with his work (e.g., blank stares, falling asleep while operating equipment).\n\nStep 2: Determine the likely condition. His symptoms are most consistent with a circadian rhythm sleep disorder, specifically delayed sleep phase syndrome. People with this disorder naturally have a later sleep onset and, when forced to adopt an earlier schedule (such as starting a day job), they become sleep deprived and suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness.

In developed countries, these typically occur secondary to adhesions.\n\nSmall bowel obstructions (SBO) typically present with an absence of bowel sounds, bowel movements, and flatus, as well as abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting. They typically occur secondary to adhesions which entrap the bowel and disrupt its normal peristalsis. Adhesions can occur after abdominal surgery or trauma as part of the normal healing process. The diagnosis of SBO can be confirmed using abdominal imaging such as a CT scan. Treatment often involves observation; however, surgical decompression of the SBO may be needed if there is a closed-loop obstruction or an obstruction that does not resolve on its own.\n\nRami Reddy and Cappell review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of SBO. They discuss how this disease has a 30% mortality rate if the diagnosis is missed and bowel perforation occurs. They recommend early evaluation and treatment of these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Enteric nervous system damage describes diabetic gastroparesis which can present similarly to SBO; however, this patient's age and history of surgery points toward SBO as the most likely diagnosis.

        "final_solution": "Step 1: Analyze the clinical presentation. We are told that the boy was diagnosed with acute sinusitis and treated with decongestants but now has worsening pain and a nasal discharge that is unilateral, purulent, and mixed with blood. Although his initial symptoms might have pointed toward sinusitis (often a bilateral process), the finding of a unilateral purulent discharge with blood is more concerning for another etiology.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the answer choices. \n\n\u2022 Option A (Bleeding and infected vessel of Kiesselbach plexus) would more likely present with epistaxis from the anterior septum rather than a purulent, unilateral nasal discharge.\n\u2022 Option C (Nasopharyngeal carcinoma) is rare in children.\n\u2022 Option D (Septal perforation) would not typically present with this pattern of discharge and in such a young patient without a history of trauma or cocaine use.\n\u2022 Option E (Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection) could worsen sinusitis symptoms overall but usually doesn\u2019t cause a unilateral purulent discharge \u2013 sinusitis usually affects both sides.\n\u2022 Option B (Foreign body obstruction) classically presents in children with a unilateral, often foul-smelling and purulent nasal discharge, sometimes mixed with blood due to irritation of the nasal mucosa.\n\nStep 3: Synthesize the information. Given the child\u2019s age, the unilateral nature of the nasal discharge, and the mixture of pus and blood, the most likely diagnosis is a foreign body lodged in the nasal cavity.\n\nFinal answer: B. Foreign body obstruction."
