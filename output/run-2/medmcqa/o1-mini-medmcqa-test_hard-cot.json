Thumbs are usually included because they are large and distinct. The little fingers, while unique, are often excluded in systems that require fewer fingerprints to streamline the process.\n\n**Conclusion**: The little finger pair is excluded in the FINDER fingerprinting system.\n\n**Answer:** C",
        "thinking": "The text states that the FINDER fingerprinting system records the fingerprints of 8 fingers out of the 10 available, thereby excluding 2 fingers.

However, this depends on the specific clinical situation and patient needs.\n\n**Option B:** *Should be cemented with a polycarboxylate cement to ensure retention between the preparation and fitting stages*  \n- **Analysis:** Polycarboxylate cement is commonly used for temporary bridges because it provides sufficient retention and is relatively easy to remove when transitioning to the permanent bridge. This ensures the temporary bridge stays in place during the interim period.\n\n**Option C:** *Should have the same buccal and lingual contours as the permanent bridge*  \n- **Analysis:** Temporary bridges are typically simpler and may not replicate all the detailed contours of a permanent bridge. Their primary purpose is to maintain aesthetics and function temporarily.\n\n**Option D:** *Should restore the occlusion to the same extent as the permanent bridge*  \n- **Analysis:** While temporary bridges aim to restore function, they do not need to perfectly match the occlusion of the permanent bridge. Their main role is to maintain the space and provide temporary functionality.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOption **B** is the most accurate statement regarding the cementation of a temporary bridge constructed from synthetic resin.\n\n**Answer:**  \nB",

It is caused by antibodies in the transfused blood products that activate the recipient's leukocytes, leading to increased vascular permeability and pulmonary edema.\n   - **Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO):** This is a cardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting from volume overload due to rapid transfusion rates or excessive fluid administration.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options:**\n   - **(A) Transfusion related lung injury:** This aligns with **TRALI**, which directly causes pulmonary edema and the Batwing sign.\n   - **(B) Due to overload of PPF:** Assuming PPF refers to a plasma product, overload could lead to **TACO**, which also causes pulmonary edema. However, the Batwing sign is more specifically associated with non-cardiogenic causes like TRALI.\n   - **(C) Acute renal tubular acidosis:** This condition primarily affects the kidneys and is unrelated to the respiratory symptoms and Batwing sign.\n   - **(D) Hemoglobinuria:** This involves the presence of hemoglobin in the urine and is unrelated to pulmonary edema.\n\nGiven the presence of the Batwing sign and the acute presentation following transfusion, **Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)** is the most likely cause.\n\n**Answer:** A",
        "thinking": "The symptoms presented, particularly the Batwing sign on the X-ray, indicate pulmonary edema that is typically associated with Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI).

Injecting here allows the anesthetic to diffuse effectively around the multiple roots and associated nerve branches, providing comprehensive anesthesia for the second molar.\n\n**D) Apical perforation and injection**\n- Apical injection focuses on the apex of a single root and may not address all nerve branches, especially in molars with multiple roots.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nInjecting in the furcation area ensures that the anesthetic reaches all necessary nerve branches supplying the mandibular second molar, making it the optimal location.\n\n**Answer:** C",

Causes can include fibrinogen abnormalities, presence of inhibitors like heparin, or excessive fibrin degradation products.\n4. **Normal Fibrinogen and Platelet Counts**: Rules out conditions like DIC (where fibrinogen and platelets are typically decreased) and certain other coagulation disorders.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n- **(A) DIC**: Typically presents with prolonged PT, APTT, and TT, but usually with decreased fibrinogen and platelet counts.

Pregnancy significantly increases the risk of mortality and severe complications in these patients. Due to the high maternal and fetal risks, LSCS is considered an absolute indication.\n\n**C) Ebstein's Anomaly**\n- **Explanation:** This is a congenital heart defect affecting the tricuspid valve.

However, nerve fibers are still not present in the vicinity of the dental papilla at this stage.\n\n3. **Bell Stage**: This stage involves significant differentiation of cells.

        "raw_response": "To determine the most suitable surgical procedure for a mandibular setback exceeding 10 mm, let's analyze each option:\n\n**A) Sagittal Split Ramus Osteotomy (SSRO):**\n- Commonly used for mandibular setbacks.\n- Generally suitable for movements up to about 10 mm.\n- For movements greater than 10 mm, there is an increased risk of relapse and complications.\n\n**B) Vertical Ramus Osteotomy:**\n- Typically refers to intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO).\n- Suitable for moderate setbacks but may not be ideal for very large movements beyond 10 mm.\n\n**C) Subapical Osteotomy:**\n- Specifically designed to handle large mandibular movements exceeding 10 mm.\n- Allows for greater flexibility and stabilization during significant setbacks.\n- Reduces the risk of relapse compared to other osteotomies when large movements are required.\n\n**D) Body Osteotomy with Extraction of Premolars:**\n- More commonly used for orthodontic adjustments and moderate structural changes.\n- Not specifically tailored for large mandibular setbacks.\n\nGiven the need for a significant mandibular setback greater than 10 mm, **Subapical Osteotomy** is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Answer:** C",
        "thinking": "The text discusses the suitability of various surgical options for a mandibular setback of over 10 mm, analyzing each option for its appropriateness. The Subapical Osteotomy is highlighted as specifically designed for such large movements, making it the most suitable choice for this scenario.",
