In disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), you typically expect low fibrinogen levels and a reduced platelet count. Factor VIII deficiency would prolong APTT alone rather than affecting PT and TT. Vitamin K deficiency tends to prolong PT (and sometimes APTT) while TT remains normal. These findings point towards liver disease, where impaired synthesis of clotting factors (and production of dysfunctional fibrinogen) can lead to increases in PT, APTT, and TT despite normal fibrinogen levels. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C.",

A bag and mask (like a bag-valve mask) could provide nearly 100% oxygen during resuscitation, but for continuous oxygen therapy in a clinical setting, the mask with reservoir (often a non-rebreather mask) is designed to deliver a very high concentration of oxygen.

In adults, because the epiphyses have closed, long bone length does not increase, but soft tissues and bones such as the mandible continue to thicken. This often leads to an increase in the height of the mandible and can cause spacing between teeth. Given these clinical features, hyperpituitarism (acromegaly) is the most likely explanation for the described changes.\n\nA",
