        "question": "A 64-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a headache and nausea. He reports that he was rocking his grandson to sleep when the symptoms began. He states the pain is constant and is primarily located on his right side. When asked to indicate the area of pain, he says that it surrounds his eye and upper forehead. He had one episode of vomiting. The patient also reports difficulty seeing out of his right eye, which he attributes to excessive tearing. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for hypertension. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 135/91 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 12/min. The patient\u2019s right eye is shown in Figure A. Upon physical examination, the right pupil is minimally responsive to light and the globe feels firm. A right-sided carotid bruit is appreciated. Which of the following is the most appropriate prophylaxis for this patient\u2019s condition?",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden-onset unilateral vision loss and an orbitofrontal headache with a dilated pupil and a hard ocular globe suggesting a diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Long-term management of angle-closure glaucoma can include acetazolamide.\n\nExamination of the eye in a patient with acute-closure glaucoma will reveal a red eye that is rock-hard and a mid-dilated pupil which is minimally reactive to light. The fundoscopic exam will show an increased optic cup-to-disk ratio (>0.4) and tonometry will show increased intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Acute treatment and long-term management involve the administration of beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide to decrease intraocular pressure. The definitive treatment is iridotomy.\n\nAiraksinen et al. review the treatment of closed-angle glaucoma. They discuss how a combination of acetazolamide and beta-blockers can terminate an attack. They recommend using 1 drop of pilocarpine 3 hours after intravenous acetazolamide administration.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing an eye with injected conjunctiva (red circles) and a mid-dilated pupil. These findings are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Amitriptyline can be used as prophylaxis for migraines. Migraines present as unilateral, pulsating headaches that may be associated with nausea or photophobia. Patients with migraines can sometimes experience an aura with visual field changes; however, they would not have exam findings of a rock-hard eye or injection.\n\nAnswer C: Clopidogrel may be used as a conservative treatment for carotid atherosclerosis, which can be an embolic source for central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO presents as acute, painless, monocular vision loss. A fundoscopic exam will demonstrate ischemia of the retina.\n\nAnswer D: Epinephrine is contraindicated in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma as it increases pupillary dilation. It is used in the management of open-angle glaucoma. This would present with gradually patchy loss of vision and is generally painless.\n\nAnswer E: Verapamil is used as prophylaxis for cluster headaches. Cluster headaches present as unilateral, repetitive, brief headaches associated with severe peri-orbital pain, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPharmacologic management of acute angle-closure glaucoma involves beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",

            "Step 1: Analyze the clinical presentation.\n\u2022 The patient is a 64\u2010year\u2010old man with a sudden, constant headache focused around his right eye and upper forehead. He also has nausea and vomiting.\n\u2022 He reports difficulty seeing from the right eye with excessive tearing.\n\u2022 The exam reveals that the right globe is \u201cfirm\u201d (suggesting increased intraocular pressure) and the right pupil is minimally reactive to light. Although a right\u2010sided carotid bruit is noted, this is most likely an incidental finding in a patient with hypertension and atherosclerotic disease.\n\nStep 2: Determine the diagnosis.\n\u2022 The constellation of periorbital/forehead pain, ocular symptoms (tearing, decreased visual acuity), a firm globe on palpation, and a poorly reactive pupil is highly suggestive of acute angle closure glaucoma. This condition leads to a rapid rise in intraocular pressure causing the eye to feel firm, and can also produce nausea and vomiting.\n\u2022 (Note: Cluster headaches can also cause periorbital pain and lacrimation; however, the firm globe and decreased pupillary reactivity are not features of cluster headaches.)\n\nStep 3: Identify the appropriate prophylactic/therapeutic measure.\n\u2022 In acute angle closure glaucoma, the goal is to rapidly lower intraocular pressure and prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is a mainstay of initial management because it reduces the production of aqueous humor.\n\u2022 Although definitive prophylaxis for future episodes often involves procedures such as laser peripheral iridotomy, among the medication options provided, acetazolamide is the one indicated for decreasing intraocular pressure and thereby helping prevent recurrence.\n\nStep 4: Compare and eliminate the other options.\n\u2022 Amitriptyline is used for migraine prophylaxis.\n\u2022 Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent used in cerebrovascular disease.\n\u2022 Epinephrine is not used in this setting.\n\u2022 Verapamil is used for cluster headache prophylaxis.\n\u2022 None of these address the pathophysiology of increased intraocular pressure seen in angle closure glaucoma.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Acetazolamide.",
            "Step 1: Examine key features in the history and exam.\n\n\u2022 The patient is a 64\u2010year\u2010old man with a headache that started while he was rocking his grandson. The headache is constant, unilateral (right side), and located around the eye and upper forehead.\n\u2022 There is associated nausea with one episode of vomiting.\n\u2022 The patient also reports difficulty with vision on the affected side, which he attributes to excessive tearing.\n\u2022 On exam, the right eye shows a minimally responsive pupil and is described as \u201cfirm\u201d on palpation. A right\u2010sided carotid bruit is noted.\n\nStep 2: Consider the differential diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Although some findings (e.g., eye pain, nausea/vomiting, visual changes, and autonomic features such as tearing) might be seen in acute angle-closure glaucoma, the fact that the question is asking for prophylaxis (i.e., prevention of recurrent episodes) makes this less likely. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is managed emergently (first with agents such as acetazolamide, pilocarpine, etc.) and then definitively with a laser peripheral iridotomy, but none of these options are listed.\n\u2022 The features of unilateral pain around the eye/forehead with associated lacrimation (tearing) and autonomic dysfunction are strongly consistent with a cluster headache. Cluster headaches are known for their severe unilateral periorbital pain accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (e.g., lacrimation, conjunctival injection, and sometimes a mildly altered pupillary response).\n\nStep 3: Match the prophylactic treatment.\n\n\u2022 Cluster headache management includes both abortive treatment (high-flow oxygen, triptans) and prophylactic treatment. The most common prophylactic medication for cluster headaches is verapamil.\n\u2022 Among the answer choices:\n\u2003-Acetazolamide is used to lower intraocular pressure (acute treatment of glaucoma).\n\u2003-Amitriptyline is typically used for migraine or tension headache prophylaxis.\n\u2003-Clopidogrel is for antiplatelet stroke prevention.\n\u2003-Epinephrine is not used in headache prophylaxis.\n\u2003-Verapamil is the classic prophylactic treatment for cluster headaches.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer.\n\nThe most appropriate prophylaxis for this patient\u2019s condition (cluster headache) is Verapamil.\n\nFinal Answer: E. Verapamil",

Key Features of the Patient\u2019s Presentation:\n\u2022 A 64\u2010year\u2010old man presents with a headache and nausea.\n\u2022 The pain is unilateral, localized around his right eye and upper forehead.\n\u2022 There is one episode of vomiting.\n\u2022 He also has difficulty seeing out of his right eye with associated tearing.\n\u2022 On exam the right pupil is minimally reactive to light and the globe feels firm.\n\u2022 A right\u2010sided carotid bruit is noted on exam, which, while it may be incidental or related to his vascular disease, does not directly point to the headache syndrome.\n\nStep 2. Differential Diagnosis for Unilateral Headache with Autonomic Symptoms:\nThe combination of unilateral, periorbital pain with lacrimation (tearing) in an older male is most consistent with a cluster headache. Cluster headaches are known for severe unilateral pain, often around the eye, with autonomic symptoms that can include lacrimation and, sometimes, ptosis or miosis. Although some exam findings (like the firm globe) could suggest increased intraocular pressure seen in conditions such as acute angle-closure glaucoma, the overall clinical picture (including the headache quality, autonomic symptoms, and the patient\u2019s demographics) fits better with cluster headache.\n\nStep 3. Review of the Options for Prophylaxis:\n\u2022 Acetazolamide \u2013 Used mainly in the treatment of glaucoma by reducing intraocular pressure.\n\u2022 Amitriptyline \u2013 A tricyclic antidepressant used for migraine prophylaxis but not the first-line agent for cluster headaches.\n\u2022 Clopidogrel \u2013 An antiplatelet agent used in ischemic disease prophylaxis.\n\u2022 Epinephrine \u2013 Typically used in emergency settings such as anaphylaxis.\n\u2022 Verapamil \u2013 A calcium channel blocker that is considered the first-line prophylactic treatment for cluster headaches.\n\nStep 4. Final Decision:\nGiven the overall clinical presentation most consistent with cluster headache and the prophylaxis options provided, the best choice for prevention of the patient\u2019s condition is Verapamil.\n\nFinal Answer: E.

Typically, this is a parent feigning or creating symptoms in a child in order to receive the psychiatric gain of attention from healthcare personnel.

Gastroenteritis does not best explain the most likely underlying cause of this patient's presentation.\n\nAnswer B: Immunodeficiency such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) would present with lifelong infections from birth that are bacterial, viral, and fungal.

Now she presents with a severely altered mental state, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, and shock. Although these findings could suggest a serious infection like meningitis or sepsis from a UTI, there\u2019s another critical clue.\n\n\u2022 Her father notes that when he takes care of her, she \u201cdoes not seem to get sick.\u201d This disparity between caregivers is a major red flag. In cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy (also known as factitious disorder imposed on another), a caregiver deliberately produces or fabricates symptoms in a child in order to gain attention or other benefits from the medical system.\n\n\u2022 The diverse and atypical presentation, which includes signs of meningitis as well as urinary abnormalities (like the dark, cloudy urine), coupled with the fact that her illnesses occur only when she is under one caregiver\u2019s supervision, strongly suggests that someone might be intentionally contaminating her samples or inducing symptoms.\n\n\u2022 Let\u2019s compare the provided options:\n\u2003A. Gastroenteritis \u2013 Doesn\u2019t fit the neurological signs.\n\u2003B. Immunodeficiency \u2013 Less likely given her normal development and the observation that she is well under her father\u2019s care.\n\u2003C. Intentional contamination \u2013 Fits with the caregiver discrepancy and the pattern of recurrences.\n\u2003D. Meningitis \u2013 While she does have meningitic signs, this does not account for the pattern of repeated illnesses and the caregiver discrepancy.\n\u2003E. Urinary tract infection \u2013 Again, does not explain the overall clinical picture and the inconsistent occurrence with different caregivers.\n\nThe most appropriate explanation is that the caregiver (implied to be the one present when the child is sick) is intentionally contaminating or inducing the symptoms.\n\nFinal answer: C.

Intentional contamination \u2013 The fact that she presents with recurrent infections only in one care setting (implied to be under her mother\u2019s care) raises concern for caregiver-induced illness (factitious disorder imposed on another). The repeated E. coli UTIs and now a severe presentation (shock, meningitic signs) in a clinically well, vaccinated child are worrisome.  \nD. Meningitis \u2013 While she has features (headache, stiff neck) that might be seen in meningitis, this does not explain the recurring nature of the infections or the detail provided by her father\u2019s observation.  \nE.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after syncope, likely secondary to dehydration and orthostatic hypotension given his outdoor gardening in the heat and symptoms when standing up rapidly. The patient\u2019s ECG reveals deep, pathologic Q waves, which in this case are an incidental finding indicative of a previous myocardial infarction or a previous ischemic event.\n\nThe Q wave is a negative deflection just prior to the R wave. Q waves are a normal finding when they are small and are seen on most ECGs. However, pathologic Q waves are indicative of myocardial ischemia. Pathologic Q waves are generally diagnosed when they are >2 mm deep, >1 mm wide, >25% of the QRS complex height, or are seen in leads V1-V3. The interpretation of Q waves depends on other findings on ECG and the patient's symptoms. Deep Q waves in the setting of ST elevation indicate an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, pathologic Q waves found incidentally indicate a previous myocardial infarction or previous ischemic event.\n\nRovai et al. review Q waves. They discuss how Q waves can be used to predict the location and size of a myocardial infarction as correlated with MRI. They recommend testing such as cardiac MRI to assess for previous infarction in the appropriate patient population.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating pathologic Q waves (red arrows). Note the deep and wide Q waves; this raises concern for a past ischemic event.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Acute myocardial infarctions would present with ST elevation in a vascular distribution on ECG with possible reciprocal depressions. While T wave inversions may be indicative of new or acute ischemia, deep pathologic Q waves without ST elevation are indicative of previous infarction.\n\nAnswer B: Hypokalemia would cause U waves on ECG, which appear as a small, \"second T wave\" after the initial T wave. Note they are not U-shaped despite their name. Management is centered on repletion of potassium and often magnesium as well.\n\nAnswer C: Intermittent torsades de pointes can cause syncope and should be suspected in a patient with syncope in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. This patient\u2019s QT interval is not particularly prolonged, and his syncope seems to be secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Management is centered on cessation of QT-prolonging medications and magnesium administration. Note that while ondansetron does prolong the QT interval, it is unlikely to cause torsades given the patient took it a week ago.\n\nAnswer E: Pulmonary emboli would present on ECG with sinus tachycardia in addition to pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia. Note that the ECG is a nonspecific test for pulmonary emboli, and CT angiography is the preferred confirmatory test for this condition. Syncope is a possible presentation of larger pulmonary emboli (though the patient would also be hemodynamically unstable).\n\nBullet Summary:\nPathologic Q waves are indicative of a previous myocardial infarction.",

Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding. This stable patient with a benign exam can undergo a CT scan, which will offer more data than a FAST exam and would be performed regardless of whether a FAST exam was positive or negative given this patient's intoxication and abdominal bruising.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn a patient who has experienced blunt abdominal trauma the most appropriate initial step in a stable patient is an abdominal CT scan.",

In addition, the chest pain the patient is experiencing can also occur in pericarditis and obfuscates the diagnosis of repeat MI.\n\nAnswers 3 & 4: Ibuprofen, other NSAIDs, and corticosteroids such as prednisone are not first-line therapy in post-MI pericarditis as they can hinder the healing and remodeling process of the myocardium. Current guidelines dictate that they may be used in cases that are refractory to initial therapy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDressler syndrome (post-MI pericarditis) presents with chest pain, pericardial friction rub, fever, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG, and should be treated initially with aspirin.",

Aspirin",
            "Step 1: Gather the clinical data. The patient, a 62\u2010year\u2010old man with coronary risk factors, initially presented with a myocardial infarction. Two days into his hospital course he develops new chest pain with a repeat ECG (Figure B) that is different from his initial ECG (Figure A).\n\nStep 2: Recognize the likely diagnosis. In the setting of a recent MI, the development of chest pain a couple of days later with ECG changes is most consistent with acute pericarditis (post\u2013MI pericarditis) rather than re-infarction or stent thrombosis. This acute pericarditis occurs due to the inflammatory response to myocardial necrosis, and it can present with chest pain that may be positional and is often associated with diffuse or concave upward ST elevations on ECG.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the management options. For post\u2013MI pericarditis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used in management; however, while ibuprofen (a typical NSAID) might be considered for idiopathic pericarditis, it is generally avoided in the early post\u2013MI period because it can impair myocardial healing. Instead, high-dose aspirin is preferred because it provides anti-inflammatory effects while being cardioprotective in the post-MI setting. Angiography and stenting would be indicated for recurrent ischemia or re-infarction, but the clinical and ECG findings here are more consistent with an inflammatory process. Prednisone is reserved for patients who do not respond to aspirin or have contraindications to NSAIDs.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion. Among the options provided, high-dose Aspirin is the most appropriate treatment for this patient\u2019s post\u2013MI pericarditis.\n\nFinal answer: B. Aspirin",

Two days into his hospital course, he develops new chest pain and a repeat ECG is obtained.\n\nStep 2: Consider the complication. The timing (within days of the MI) and the recurrence of chest pain suggest post\u2013MI pericarditis (also known as early postinfarction pericarditis) rather than Dressler syndrome, which typically occurs weeks later.\n\nStep 3: Determine proper treatment for post\u2013MI pericarditis. In the setting of acute pericarditis after MI, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are typically used. However, most NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) are avoided because they can interfere with myocardial scar formation. High-dose aspirin is preferred because, besides its anti-inflammatory properties, it also preserves the beneficial antiplatelet effect necessary in the post-MI setting. Corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) are generally reserved for cases where high-dose aspirin is contraindicated or poorly tolerated due to potential adverse effects on healing.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate incorrect options.\n\u2022 Angiography and stenting are interventions typically used for acute coronary syndromes and revascularization, not for post\u2013MI pericarditis.\n\u2022 Ibuprofen is contraindicated due to its negative effects on myocardial healing post-MI.\n\u2022 Prednisone is not first-line as initial management for post\u2013MI pericarditis.\n\nStep 5: Final answer.\nThe best next step in management for this patient\u2019s underlying condition is high-dose aspirin.\n\nFinal Answer: Aspirin"

Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk. Patients will also develop bilateral cataracts if the deficit is not detected in the first few weeks after birth. Avoiding galactose by changing to a soy-based formula will avoid the complications of this disorder.\n\nTurck discusses using soy protein for infant feeding. The author notes that there are safety concerns with regards to the high phyto-estrogenic isoflavone content of these formulas. The author recommends that despite these safety concerns, these formulas should still be used in patients with classic galactosemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Avoiding fruit juice and sweetened foods would be effective in the treatment of hereditary fructose intolerance.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago. In general, if the patient's airway is secure, it does no harm and could offer some benefit by decreasing the absorption of the substance of interest.\n\nAnswer C: IV fluid administration is the most appropriate initial step in the management of trauma when there is suspected bleeding and vitals are unstable (hypotension and tachycardia). Fluids are not urgently needed in this toxicity case with a patient who has stable vitals.\n\nAnswer E: Syrup of ipecac induces emesis in patients and was previously used in an attempt to have the patient vomit the toxic substance. This is no longer a preferred method of managing toxicities as patients can aspirate the vomitus or the toxic substance can induce more tissue damage during vomiting.

        "reason": "This patient's non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, alkaline urine, and history of a calcium phosphate kidney stone and rheumatoid arthritis are suggestive of type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis. The treatment of choice is alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate).\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis results from impaired acid (H+) secretion in the distal nephron. Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis. They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case. The patient's muscle weakness is more suggestive of hypokalemia secondary to type 1 renal tubular acidosis. She does not report symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (joint pain/stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with use).\n\nBullet Summary:\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis is treated with alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate).",

His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy. The authors recommend the use of endoscopic ultrasound in securing the diagnosis in patients with equivocal imaging findings and a high index of suspicion, such as patients with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating calcifications and chronic inflammatory injury (red arrows) suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone is the appropriate management of infectious diarrhea from a bacterial organism. This usually presents with fever, as well as bloody or purulent diarrhea. In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected. This patient\u2019s diarrhea is likely caused by his chronic pancreatitis; thus, oral rehydration may be indicated but does not address the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s diarrhea.\n\nAnswer E: Rifaximin is an antibiotic that targets gut flora and can decrease enteric flora and treat conditions such as small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Small bowel bacterial overgrowth presents in patients with conditions such as diabetic gastroparesis or scleroderma secondary to decreased bowel motility causing bacterial overgrowth and profuse diarrhea. Treating the underlying cause in addition to rifaximin will eliminate the excess bacteria.\n\nBullet Summary:\nProton pump inhibitors should be given in patients with persistent diarrhea in the setting of chronic pancreatitis to prevent the inactivation of pancreatic enzymes.",

As the pancreatic enzymes are needed for fat digestion, their deficiency results in persistent steatorrhea (\u201cfoul\u2010smelling diarrhea\u201d) and can lead to malabsorption of fat\u2010soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). The hypocalcemia in this patient can occur as a consequence of vitamin D deficiency secondary to fat malabsorption.\n\nThe best treatment for this condition is to provide pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) so that the patient is able to digest and absorb fats (and other nutrients) properly. Unfortunately, among the provided answer options (ciprofloxacin, loperamide, oral rehydration, pantoprazole, and rifaximin), none directly represents pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Although antibiotics (like rifaximin) are used to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth\u2014a potential secondary complication\u2014and symptomatic treatments (like loperamide or oral rehydration) are helpful to manage diarrhea, they do not address the underlying cause.\n\nThus, while none of the choices is correct, the most appropriate treatment for this patient\u2019s underlying condition is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.\n\nFinal Answer: Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (which is not among the provided answer choices).",
            "Step 1: Recognize the key features of the patient\u2019s presentation.\n\u2022 The patient is a 59\u2010year\u2010old man with a long history of alcohol abuse.\n\u2022 He has had recurrent hospital admissions for alcohol withdrawal and other alcohol\u2010related issues.\n\u2022 He now presents with chronic (2-year) abdominal pain and foul\u2010smelling diarrhea.\n\u2022 His stool is positive on a Sudan Black stain, which detects excess fat (i.e. steatorrhea).\n\u2022 His serum calcium is low (7.0 mg/dL), which can be seen in fat malabsorption (due to decreased vitamin D absorption) as occurs with pancreatic insufficiency.\n\u2022 A CT scan of the abdomen (Figure A) is provided \u2013 in a patient like this, one would expect to see changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis (e.g., pancreatic calcifications, atrophy).\n\nStep 2: Connect these findings.\n\u2022 The classic picture here is chronic pancreatitis in the setting of long\u2010term alcohol abuse.\n\u2022 Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency results from the chronic damage to the pancreas, leading to fat malabsorption (steatorrhea) and its complications.\n\u2022 The underlying problem is a lack of pancreatic enzymes, not an infection or inflammatory process of the bowel.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the answer options.\n\u2022 A. Ciprofloxacin \u2013 an antibiotic used for bacterial infections; not appropriate for pancreatic enzyme deficiency.\n\u2022 B. Loperamide \u2013 an antidiarrheal that may slow motility, but it does not address the malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency.\n\u2022 C. Oral rehydration \u2013 supportive care only and does not correct the underlying malabsorption.\n\u2022 D. Pantoprazole \u2013 a proton pump inhibitor used for acid suppression; it does nothing to replace missing pancreatic enzymes.\n\u2022 E. Rifaximin \u2013 an antibiotic used in conditions such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth; it is not indicated for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.\n\nStep 4: Determine the Correct Treatment.\n\u2022 The patient\u2019s underlying condition is chronic pancreatitis leading to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.\n\u2022 The standard management of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (e.g., pancrelipase), which helps with digestion and reduces steatorrhea.\n\u2022 Although \u201cpancreatic enzyme replacement\u201d is not listed among the options, none of the available answers treat the underlying cause.\n\u2022 Therefore, the proper treatment for this patient is pancreatic enzyme supplementation rather than any of the listed therapies.\n\nFinal Answer:\nNone of the provided answer choices are correct; the appropriate treatment is pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (e.g., pancrelipase)."

Cerebral infarction\n\u2003\u2022 Stroke usually presents with additional neurological deficits and typically not isolated to one limb over a period of weeks.\n\u2003\u2022 The chronicity of the symptoms and the localized distribution make this less likely.\n\nD. Scalenus anticus syndrome\n\u2003\u2022 This thoracic outlet syndrome variant typically presents with symptoms that can be provoked or worsened by certain head and neck movements.\n\u2003\u2022 Because his symptoms are not positional, this is unlikely.\n\nE. Subclavian steal syndrome\n\u2003\u2022 This condition usually presents with vertebrobasilar insufficiency and arm claudication related to exertion.\n\u2003\u2022 The presentation typically includes differences in blood pressure between arms and neurovascular symptoms affecting the brain, which are not seen here.\n\nStep 3: Final Analysis and Choice\nThe patient\u2019s heavy smoking history, significant weight loss, and unilateral arm symptoms (including both motor weakness and sensory deficits) point toward an apical lung tumor (Pancoast tumor) invading the brachial plexus. This best explains the clinical picture provided.\n\nFinal Answer: A. Apical lung tumor"

It typically occurs in a patient with a history of sinusitis, oral contraceptive pill usage, smoking, or other risk factors that could cause a hypercoagulable state. These patients will often present with severe pain, a sudden headache, and diplopia. A distinct appearance is typically noted with periorbital edema. These patients should be immediately treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and undergo surgical drainage of the inciting source of infection. In some cases, thrombolytics can be used as well.\n\nCaranfa and Yoon review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of septic cavernous sinus thrombosis.

Of the answer choices given, angiodysplasia is the most likely to cause such profuse and sudden bleeding.\n\nAngiodysplasia is a vascular malformation found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, most commonly in the colon. The exposed vessels can bleed, leading to bright red blood per rectum. The diagnosis can be confirmed with colonoscopy. Ablation can be performed to stop the bleeding. Any patient who is unstable or anemic with a hemoglobin < 7.0 g/dL requires a transfusion with blood products. Angiodysplasia is a common cause of bright red blood per rectum but is not more common than diverticulosis.\n\nGarcia-Compeon et al. review the presentation and treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia. The authors note that angiodysplasias are the cause of many \"occult\" GI bleeds not visualized on upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. The authors recommend the use of capsule endoscopy in occult GI bleeds to identify angiodysplasias as a potential source.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Erosion into a gastric vessel is the pathophysiology of a bleeding gastric vessel secondary to peptic ulcer disease. This usually presents with melena (black tarry stools) rather than bright red blood per rectum. Only in cases of extremely brisk upper GI bleeding would patients present with bright red blood per rectum. Treatment involves treating Helicobacter pylori infection if present, proton pump inhibitors, and sucralfate. Endoscopy is needed to confirm and treat the bleeding vessel.\n\nAnswer B: Inflammation and infection of colonic outpouching is the pathophysiology of diverticulitis which presents with a history of constipation with a fever and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Management involves a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis and administration of antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or ceftriaxone and metronidazole). Diverticulosis presents with bright red blood and is possible in this patient, but it does not involve inflammation or infection, which defines diverticulitis.\n\nAnswer C: Malignancy or colon cancer can present with bright red blood per rectum, malaise, weight loss, and microcytic anemia. While it is possible in this patient, his age, lack of risk factors for colon cancer, and the sudden onset of his symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.\n\nAnswer D: Submucosal esophageal (Mallory-Weiss) tear presents after profuse vomiting (as in this patient) with bloody vomitus.

Infection can lead to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Treatment of minor infection is with amoxicillin-clavulanate; however, patients suspected of having osteomyelitis should be treated empirically with IV antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin and sulbactam) and taken for biopsy/culture to identify the pathogen. Antibiotics can then be narrowed down accordingly. Patients will often require between 4-8 weeks of antibiotic treatment.

Although amoxicillin-clavulanate (Option A) is a common oral regimen for uncomplicated bite wounds, more severe infections (like osteomyelitis) are typically managed with intravenous therapy. Ampicillin-sulbactam (Option B) provides similar spectra of coverage, including reliable coverage against Pasteurella, and is administered intravenously, making it the best choice.\n\nStep 3: The other options are less appropriate:\n\u2022 Doxycycline (Option C) is generally avoided in young children due to teeth staining and bone growth concerns.\n\u2022 Fluconazole (Option D) is an antifungal, not used for bacteria.\n\u2022 Vancomycin (Option E) mainly covers Gram-positive organisms and does not cover Pasteurella multocida.\n\nFinal Answer: B. Ampicillin and sulbactam"

The current presentation, including a persistent open wound and surrounding erythema/edema with systemic signs (fever, pain, difficulty walking), along with MRI findings consistent with osteomyelitis, indicates that the bite wound has progressed to a deep tissue infection.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate antibiotic options. \n\u2022 Amoxicillin-clavulanate (option A) is typically the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cat bite infections in an outpatient setting; however, when the infection has progressed to involve the bone (osteomyelitis), the patient usually needs IV therapy.\n\u2022 Ampicillin-sulbactam (option B) is the IV formulation that covers Pasteurella multocida as well as other common pathogens and is the treatment of choice for more severe infections, including osteomyelitis secondary to a cat bite.\n\u2022 Doxycycline (option C) is contraindicated in children under 8 years due to effects on teeth and bone.\n\u2022 Flucanozole (option D) is an antifungal, which is not useful in this bacterial infection.\n\u2022 Vancomycin (option E) is effective against MRSA and Gram-positive organisms but does not provide adequate coverage for Pasteurella multocida.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion. Given the severity of the infection and the need for IV coverage of Pasteurella multocida, the most appropriate next step in management is IV Ampicillin and sulbactam.\n\nFinal answer: B.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with symptoms of heart failure (CHF). The most likely laboratory abnormalities are elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), low sodium, and low potassium.\n\nHeart failure is characterized by the decreased performance of the cardiac ventricles resulting in ventricular dilation. As the ventricles dilate, they release BNP as a marker of stretching of myocardial tissue. BNP levels can therefore serve as a marker of CHF. The kidneys will also have decreased perfusion levels in this disease leading to several key physiologic changes. First, is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which serves to increase perfusion to the kidneys by increasing blood pressure. This system achieves increased blood pressure by maintaining sodium and fluid retention at the expense of decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and decreased hydronium ions (metabolic alkalosis). In addition, ADH is also increased to further increase perfusion, resulting in water retention, hemodilution, and hyponatremia.\n\nMa et al. studied the correlation between BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes. They found that patients with CHF and high levels of BNP had increased rates of cardiovascular complications. They recommend assessing BNP levels in patients who are suspected of having CHF.\n\nFigure A is a chart with changes in brain natriuretic peptide, anti-diuretic hormone, sodium, and potassium that would be seen in various diseases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, and high potassium does not reflect the changes that would be seen in CHF. Though aldosterone serves to retain sodium, it also absorbs water. Thus, hypernatremia would not be seen. This pattern could be seen in patients with heart failure who have high free water losses such as after a burn or in desert environments.\n\nAnswer B: High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the appropriate increase in ADH and subsequent decrease in sodium that would be seen in CHF. Patients who have diabetes insipidus can have low ADH in this setting resulting in loss of free water.\n\nAnswer D: Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the finding of elevated BNP that is classically found in the dilated ventricles of CHF. This pattern would be seen in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH where excessive resorption of free water results in hemodilution.\n\nAnswer E: Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and normal potassium reflect the findings in a healthy patient. This patient most likely has CHF, which would result in increased aldosterone and ADH function.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCommon lab findings in heart failure include elevated BNP, elevated ADH, low sodium, and low potassium.",

            "We are dealing with an elderly man with recurrent shortness of breath on exertion who now presents with signs of both left\u2010sided (bilateral crackles, S3 gallop) and right\u2010sided (peripheral edema) congestive heart failure. In addition to his physical exam findings, lab abnormalities that are commonly associated with heart failure include an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) due to increased ventricular stretch. In heart failure, decreased cardiac output also leads to reduced renal perfusion which can cause a prerenal state\u2014this usually results in an increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) with a normal or only mildly elevated creatinine, as well as dilutional hyponatremia from neurohormonal activation (i.e., activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system leading to water retention).\n\nGiven these typical lab findings for someone with heart failure:\n\u2022 Elevated BNP\n\u2022 Low serum sodium (hyponatremia)\n\u2022 Elevated BUN (often with an increased BUN/Cr ratio)\n\nFrom the options provided (A, B, C, D, and E), the set of labs that most closely matches these expected laboratory abnormalities would be the one that shows elevated BNP, hyponatremia, and a pattern of prerenal azotemia. Following our step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning, the appropriate answer is:\n\nFinal answer: Option D",
            "We can determine the answer by first recognizing that the patient\u2019s exam findings\u2013an extra heart sound immediately after S2 (an S3 gallop), bilateral lung crackles, and lower\u2010extremity edema\u2013are all hallmarks of congestive heart failure (CHF), most often due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In CHF the failing ventricle releases B\u2010type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in response to increased stretching, and the resultant neurohormonal activation (with RAAS and ADH stimulation) generally leads to prerenal azotemia (reflected in an increased BUN/creatinine ratio) and dilutional (mild) hyponatremia.\n\nThus, the laboratory profile typically seen in a patient with CHF is one with:\n\u2022\u2003An elevated BNP (often well above 100 pg/mL, and sometimes in the several hundreds)\n\u2022\u2003A high BUN/creatinine ratio (for example, a BUN that is disproportionately elevated relative to creatinine)\n\u2022\u2003A serum sodium that is often a bit low (due to ADH\u2010mediated water retention causing dilution)\n\nOf the five sets of labs provided in Figure A, the one that shows these changes (ie, markedly high BNP with relatively low sodium and an increased BUN/creatinine ratio) is the correct match for this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nAfter comparing the options and eliminating those that are inconsistent with the findings of heart failure, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Option E.",

What laboratory abnormalities are seen in heart failure?\n\nSeveral lab abnormalities are typical in chronic heart failure:\n\u2022 B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or NT-proBNP is markedly elevated in patients with heart failure because of increased ventricular wall stress.\n\u2022 Neurohormonal activation (increased renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system activity) often leads to mild hyponatremia due to water retention.\n\u2022 Because of low cardiac output, renal perfusion may decrease, which might result in a mild increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine \u2013 generally with an increased BUN:creatinine ratio.\n\nSo, an expected laboratory profile in an untreated patient with decompensated heart failure might be:\n\u2013 High BNP (often far above the normal range),\n\u2013 A low serum sodium (reflecting neurohumoral activation and water retention),\n\u2013 Possibly a modestly elevated creatinine and BUN (with a high BUN:creatinine ratio).\n\nStep 3.

Patients with homocystinuria are also at an increased risk of thromboembolic events that disproportionally affect the cerebral vessels. Similar to Marfan syndrome, patients have phenotypic features of a Marfanoid habitus, including tall stature, long limbs, arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility, skin hyperelasticity, pectus deformity, and scoliosis. Treatment includes vitamin B6 supplementation.\n\nHasan et al. review the evidence regarding diseases associated with homocystinuria. They discuss how this disease is associated with cancer and Alzheimer disease.

It is also associated with elevated homocysteine levels. Although Marfan syndrome shares many features with homocystinuria, the fair complexion, and intellectual disability seen in this patient are specific to homocystinuria. Treatment involves avoidance of contact sports and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer B: Medullary thyroid cancer is part of the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B), which is caused by a mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. Patients with MEN2B present with Marfanoid habitus, but they do not present with the other features described in this vignette, including fair complexion, intellectual disability, and downward lens subluxation. Treatment is with surgical excision of tumors.\n\nAnswer C: Osteoarthritis is a complication of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Although patients with EDS may present with many of the phenotypic features of both Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria, patients are much less likely to have lens subluxation. Osteoarthritis may be seen with higher incidence in patients with homocystinuria.

As the fourth liter of fluids is finishing, the patient is noted to have jugular venous distension and an oxygen saturation of 92% on nonrebreather. He is subsequently intubated. An ECG is obtained as seen in Figure A. The patient is started on norepinephrine, and his blood pressure is subsequently found to be 85/44 mmHg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        },
        "answer_idx": "B",
        "reason": "This patient who uses intravenous drugs with skin abscesses (the likely source of his infection) is hypotensive and tachycardic, with a blood pressure that is not responding to IV fluids; this is concerning for septic shock. Given his persistent hypotension, he should be started on vasopressors of which norepinephrine is first line and epinephrine is second line.\n\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening, systemic bacterial infection that leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Early management is centered on IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and workup to uncover the source. If the patient's blood pressure does not respond to IV fluids (by definition, their blood pressure will not respond to fluids in septic shock), vasopressors should be started with a goal mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. The first line vasopressor is norepinephrine, which can be titrated up for maximal effect. If this vasopressor fails to reach blood pressure goals, then the next vasopressor is either vasopressin or epinephrine (either is acceptable). If the second line vasopressor fails to increase blood pressure, then the third line vasopressor is vasopressin or epinephrine (whichever was not used as the second line pressor). Finally, the fourth line vasopressor for septic shock is phenylephrine.\n\nLevy et al. review sepsis. They update the Surviving Sepsis campaign which gives the most up to date management guidelines of sepsis including adequate fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors. They recommend early antibiotics and resuscitation to minimize morbidity and mortality.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating sinus tachycardia. Note the presence of P waves (red arrows highlighting several examples) that are present throughout all leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardioversion would be appropriate in an unstable patient with unstable vital signs in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to convert the patient to normal sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation would present with an irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves. Cardioversion would not be indicated in sinus tachycardia.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone is a potent glucocorticoid that also has mineralocorticoid properties. While giving an IV steroid may have a permissive effect on blood pressure (via upregulating alpha-1 receptors on the vasculature) there is no reason that this patient would have a low cortisol level (such as in chronic steroid use). Epinephrine is a better answer in this case, though steroids can be considered. Steroids are typically reserved for patients failing at least 2 vasopressors (unless they have a known cortisol-deficient state).\n\nAnswer D: Normal saline is unlikely to benefit this patient as he has already been sufficiently fluid resuscitated. Moreover, it seems the patient may be developing pulmonary edema (hypoxia, jugular venous distension), a sign of fluid overload.\n\nAnswer E: Phenylephrine is the fourth line vasopressor and is an alpha-1 agonist. It is much less potent than norepinephrine and epinephrine, and would not be started in the management of septic shock until the patient has received epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn septic shock, the vasopressors given (in order) are norepinephrine, epinephrine/vasopressin, then phenylephrine.",

            "Step 1: Review the presentation. The patient is a 43\u2010year-old IV drug user with signs of sepsis (source from skin abscesses, hypotension, tachycardia) who initially received aggressive fluid resuscitation with Ringer lactate and appropriate antibiotics. During the later phases of fluid resuscitation, he developed jugular venous distension and worsening oxygenation, suggesting fluid overload. He was then intubated and started on norepinephrine. Despite this, his blood pressure remains low (85/44 mmHg).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the management options.\n\n\u2022\u2003Cardioversion is used for certain unstable arrhythmias (for example, ventricular tachycardia or unstable supraventricular tachycardia), but there is no indication in the scenario that the patient\u2019s ECG (Figure A) shows a primary rhythm disturbance amenable to cardioversion.\n\n\u2022\u2003Epinephrine, while a potent vasopressor, is not the first choice in septic shock; norepinephrine is preferred. In refractory septic shock, epinephrine is sometimes added but may worsen tachycardia and cause arrhythmias.\n\n\u2022\u2003Hydrocortisone is indicated in patients with septic shock who remain hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and high-dose vasopressors. It acts to reduce catecholamine resistance and can help improve blood pressure.\n\n\u2022\u2003Normal saline is another fluid for resuscitation; however, the patient has signs of volume overload (JVD and oxygen desaturation), so administering more fluid is contraindicated.\n\n\u2022\u2003Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-agonist. It is not preferred in septic shock because it lacks the beta-agonist properties that help maintain cardiac output, and it may further reduce heart rate, which is not desirable in a tachycardic, hypotensive patient.\n\nStep 3: Determine the next step. Since the patient is in refractory septic shock (persistently hypotensive on norepinephrine) and already exhibits signs of volume overload, the most appropriate next step is to add hydrocortisone to his management regimen.\n\nFinal Answer: Hydrocortisone",

        "reason": "This patient with a history of possible anabolic steroid use (wrestler with acne) who presents with right upper quadrant pain and an enhancing lesion in the liver most likely has a hepatic adenoma. The treatment of hepatic adenomas is surgical removal and discontinuation of precipitating agents.\n\nHepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors that typically arise in the right hepatic lobe. They are typically solitary masses but multiple lesions can be seen in patients with prolonged contraceptive or anabolic steroid use and those who have glycogen storage disorders. Patients present with abdominal pain that is localized in the epigastrium or in the right upper quadrant. Sudden, severe abdominal pain with hypotension suggests rupture of the hepatic adenoma into the peritoneum. The lesions can be confirmed on imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. For hepatic adenomas that are < 5 cm and asymptomatic, simply discontinuing the causative drug and observing are acceptable. Large or symptomatic lesions requiring surgical resection in addition to discontinuation of the offending agent. Because these tumors are highly vascular, failure to resect may result in rupture, hemoperitoneum, and shock. Biopsy is contraindicated to avoid rupturing the mass and causing hemorrhage.\n\nKlompenhouwer et al. studied the current management strategies in patients with hepatocellular adenoma. They found that various molecular groups have been identified allowing for subtyping of these lesions. They recommend performing a CT scan to better characterize these lesions.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT with an enhancing mass with a hypoattenuating fatty component. This is characteristically seen in large hepatic adenomas, which are solitary well-marginated lesions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole would be an effective treatment if this patient had contracted Entamoeba histolytica from contaminated food or water on his recent trip to Mexico. While this amoeba can lead to a liver abscess presenting as a mass on CT, it often also causes abdominal pain and dysentery due to intestinal involvement.\n\nAnswer B: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used for hepatitis C. This patient does have risk factors for hepatitis C (risky sexual behavior and intravenous drug use). Although hepatitis C could lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cause a liver mass, this patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Even if he did have hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatitis C alone without surgical resection or adjuvant therapies would be insufficient.\n\nAnswer C: Follow-up CT in 3 months would be dangerous for this man with a large hepatic adenoma. In the interim, the mass will likely continue to grow if he continues to use anabolic steroids, increasing the risk of rupture. Observation and repeat imaging may be suitable for asymptomatic hepatic lesions that are of uncertain but likely benign etiology.\n\nAnswer D: Biopsying the liver mass is appropriate if malignancy is suspected and there is no concern for hepatic adenoma. If an adenoma is on the differential, biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of rupture and hemorrhage intraoperatively.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHepatic adenomas are benign, vascular liver masses associated with oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids that should be promptly resected if large and symptomatic.",

        "reason": "This postpartum patient is presenting with hypertension, headache, blurry vision, and abdominal pain, which are concerning for a diagnosis of preeclampsia. The most appropriate initial intervention is magnesium.\n\nPreeclampsia classically presents after 20 weeks gestation (or earlier in the setting of a molar pregnancy) with hypertension and proteinuria. Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed. The most important initial step in management is to administer magnesium which is neuroprotective and also modestly lowers blood pressure. Further care involves blood pressure control and benzodiazepines as needed to abort seizure episodes (though note that if a patient with preeclampsia is having seizures, by definition, they have eclampsia).\n\nAl-Safi et al. discuss preeclampsia and eclampsia. They note that postpartum preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur within the first week after delivery. They recommend that mothers should be educated on what symptoms to look for.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT head may be indicated, in particular, if an intracranial hemorrhage was thought to be the cause of this patient\u2019s headache and vision changes. A subarachnoid hemorrhage would present with the classic \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache with blood in the subarachnoid space on head CT. A CTA may localize a bleeding aneurysm and a lumbar puncture would show an elevated red blood cell count in the CSF. It would not explain this patient\u2019s hypertension and abdominal pain. Note that a CT head is not a CTV which is specific venous imaging.\n\nAnswer B: Labetalol is an appropriate blood pressure medication to give in pregnancy; however, it is more appropriate to first give magnesium as this agent is neuroprotective and is the first-line agent of choice in preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer D: MRV head or a CTV head would be appropriate in the workup of cerebral venous thrombosis which is common in the setting of hypercoagulability (such as in the postpartum period) and presents with headache, blurry vision, and seizures. Note that it would not explain this patient\u2019s profound hypertension. It would be more reasonable to first empirically treat this patient's possible preeclampsia.\n\nAnswer E: Ondansetron and morphine would be appropriate symptomatic management of this patient but would not treat her underlying preeclampsia. It is more appropriate to first treat the life-threatening diagnosis before symptom management. If this patient\u2019s hypertension was thought to be due to pain, then morphine could be helpful.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPreeclampsia can occur in the postpartum period and should be managed with magnesium sulfate.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with nasal packing, hypotension, tachycardia, a dark, purpuric rash, and confusion, which are concerning for toxic shock syndrome. The most important initial step in management is to administer clindamycin.\n\nToxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening diagnosis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus and occurs commonly secondary to retained tampons or nasal packing. Patients are critically ill and require immediate management with fluids, vasopressors, and blood cultures. Source control is imperative, and the foreign body causing the infection must be removed. Next, broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started immediately. Clindamycin is often preferred as the first agent as this lincosamide antibiotic not only covers Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also has the theoretical benefit of suppressing toxin production. Further management is centered on fluid administration, vasopressors, and monitoring and care in an ICU setting as these patients are typically critically ill.\n\nRussell and Pachorek review the treatments for toxic shock syndrome. They note that clindamycin is particularly important in toxic shock syndrome that is complicated by toxin production. They recommend that administration may reduce toxin production and could improve outcomes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Meropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers most organisms except for MRSA. It is generally not used as a first-line agent unless the patient has allergies to other antibiotics or the infectious organism is only sensitive to this agent. Even in toxic shock syndrome, it would not be used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer C: Penicillin may be used for infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, which presents with a sore throat, fever, and tonsillar exudates. It is a relatively weaker antibiotic and would not be used in a critically ill patient with toxic shock syndrome.\n\nAnswers 4 & 5: Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin represent a powerful broad-spectrum regimen of antibiotics that covers gram-positives, gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobes (piperacillin-tazobactam) as well as further gram-positive coverage and MRSA (vancomycin). Though this is a potent antibiotic combination, neither of these takes priority over clindamycin given the possible benefit of toxin suppression from clindamycin. In this patient, clindamycin and piperacillin-tazobactam would be an appropriate antibiotic regimen.\n\nBullet Summary:\nClindamycin may suppress toxin production and should be given early in toxic shock syndrome.",

            "Step 1: Recognize the Risk Factor and Presentation\nThe patient had nasal packing for epistaxis while on warfarin. Nasal packing is a well-known risk factor for toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus producing superantigens. His presentation\u2014with hypotension, high heart and respiratory rates, altered mental status, and a dark, purpuric rash\u2014is consistent with TSS.\n\nStep 2: Understand Management Priorities\nInitial management includes removing the source (nasal packing, which has been done), providing supportive care (IV fluids, as given), and promptly starting antibiotics. In TSS, the prone toxin production by bacteria is a significant part of the pathology.\n\nStep 3: Choose the Appropriate Antibiotic\nWhile broad-spectrum agents like vancomycin or piperacillin-tazobactam might cover various pathogens, the most important step in managing TSS is to inhibit toxin production. Clindamycin is known to inhibit protein synthesis, thereby reducing toxin production, which is crucial in improving outcomes in TSS.\n\nStep 4: Exclude Other Options\n\u2022 Meropenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem but not first line for toxin suppression.\n\u2022 Penicillin is not as effective in inhibiting toxin production.\n\u2022 Piperacillin-tazobactam, while broad, does not have the anti-toxin effect.\n\u2022 Vancomycin is more for MRSA coverage and lacks the anti-toxin benefits of clindamycin.\n\nFinal Answer: Clindamycin\n\nThus, the antibiotic that should be administered first in this patient is Clindamycin.",

Nasal packing is a known risk factor for toxin\u2010mediated illnesses such as staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS).\n\nStep 2: Reasoning about toxic shock syndrome. In staphylococcal TSS, the bacteria produce superantigens (e.g., TSST-1) that drive a cytokine storm. Removal of the source (here, the nasal packing) and prompt supportive care are essential. However, rapid administration of an antibiotic regimen is also crucial. Clindamycin is particularly important because it not only has antimicrobial activity but also suppresses bacterial toxin production by interrupting protein synthesis.

            "Let's break down the question step by step:\n\n1. The patient is a 7-year-old boy who experiences fainting episodes during basketball practice. The episodes are brief (less than a minute) and occur without any prodromes, suggesting a cardiac etiology rather than a vasovagal syncope with warning signs.\n\n2. His evaluation includes an ECG (Figure A, which we must assume shows abnormal findings) and an echocardiogram is being ordered. Given his age and the fact that syncope is occurring during exercise, one must consider a cardiac condition that can lead to sudden cardiac death in young athletes.\n\n3. Let\u2019s review the options:\n\n\u2022 Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia is typically seen in adolescents and young adults and involves fatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium. Although it can cause exercise-induced arrhythmias, it is less common in a 7-year-old.\n\n\u2022 Brugada syndrome classically presents with a specific ECG pattern (coved ST-segment elevations in the right precordial leads) and typically affects adult males. It is uncommon in a child this young.\n\n\u2022 Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. It typically presents with exercise-induced syncope and may be associated with specific findings on ECG (such as left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormal repolarization) and on echocardiogram (asymmetric septal hypertrophy).\n\n\u2022 QT prolongation may cause syncope but is more often related to episodes with a history of seizures or multiple syncope events triggered by varying circumstances. The ECG in QT prolongation would characteristically reveal a prolonged QT interval.\n\n\u2022 Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome is identified by a short PR interval and delta waves on the ECG, and while it can lead to tachyarrhythmias, the history and exercise-induced syncope isn\u2019t as classic a presentation.\n\n4. Considering the patient\u2019s presentation \u2013 a young, physically active child with exercise-induced syncope, and assuming the ECG findings are suggestive \u2013 the most likely diagnosis is Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.\n\nFinal answer: C.

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients.

            "We\u2019re told that the patient has a murmur heard \u201cafter S2\u201d along the left sternal border. This timing suggests a diastolic murmur. In a patient with long\u2010standing hypertension (and other risk factors such as obesity) a likely cause of a diastolic murmur along the left sternal border is aortic regurgitation. In aortic regurgitation, blood flows back from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole, producing a high\u2010pitched \u201cblowing\u201d decrescendo diastolic murmur. One hemodynamic hallmark in this condition is that, despite the elevated volume load in the left ventricle (and a resultant elevated left ventricular end\u2010diastolic pressure), the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (which approximates left atrial pressure) may not be proportionately elevated. Therefore, one may find a wedge pressure that is lower than one would otherwise expect in the context of the left ventricular pressures.\n\nLet\u2019s briefly consider the options:\n\n\u2022 Option A (Audible click heard at the cardiac apex) is seen in cases of mitral valve prolapse.\n\u2022 Option B (Femoral artery murmur) might be heard in other vascular conditions (such as arteriovenous fistulas) but not classically with aortic regurgitation.\n\u2022 Option C (Murmur that radiates to the carotids during systole) describes the systolic murmur of aortic stenosis.\n\u2022 Option D (Rumbling heard at the cardiac apex) is typically found in mitral stenosis.\n\u2022 Option E (Wedge pressure lower than expected) is consistent with the hemodynamic findings sometimes seen in aortic regurgitation, where the left ventricular end\u2010diastolic pressure may be elevated relative to a normal or only mildly elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.\n\nThus, the best answer is:\n\nE.

It presents with stupor/obtundation, bradycardia, hemodynamic instability, and hypothermia. With a high clinical suspicion, appropriate history, physical exam, and vitals, it is appropriate to first treat the patient with IV hydrocortisone (or another highly potent steroid) and levothyroxine prior to confirming the diagnosis given the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Triiodothyronine is given in some circumstances as well (in more ill patients) but is less dire than first giving levothyroxine. Subsequently, the diagnosis can be confirmed with a serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 level. Patients are critically ill and typically require further care in an ICU.\n\nWall discusses the management of myxedema coma. He notes this is a potentially lethal condition. He recommends immediate administration of IV levothyroxine.\n\nFigure A is an ECG with sinus bradycardia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1, 3, & 4: Thyroid stimulating hormone and free T4 levels should certainly be obtained; however, the mortality for myxedema coma is so high that empiric treatment with levothyroxine should be started with clinical suspicion alone prior to confirming the diagnosis with laboratory studies, as a delay in therapy could increase morbidity and mortality. After administration of levothyroxine and initial supportive therapy, the diagnosis can be supported with laboratory studies.\n\nAnswer E: Triiodothyronine or T3 could be appropriate in patients with myxedema coma in severe scenarios where patients do not respond to levothyroxine. In some cases, it may also be given empirically but does not take priority over T4 administration.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIn myxedema coma, empiric treatment with levothyroxine is appropriate with a high clinical suspicion for the diagnosis prior to laboratory confirmation.",

            "Let\u2019s analyze the case step by step:\n\n1. The patient is an elderly man with a history of hypothyroidism who presents with severe hypothermia (88.0\u00b0F), marked bradycardia (35/min), hypotension (92/62 mmHg), and altered mental status. These, along with the fact that he was found obtunded, are classic features of myxedema coma\u2014a life\u2010threatening decompensation of hypothyroidism.\n\n2. In myxedema coma, supportive care must be initiated promptly, which includes warming measures, IV fluids, vasopressor (norepinephrine) support, and even glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone) to cover for possible adrenal insufficiency. In this patient, those interventions have already been started.\n\n3. Although confirming the thyroid status with laboratory tests (TSH and free T4) is important, in a patient with a prior history of hypothyroidism and a clinical picture that strongly suggests myxedema coma, definitive treatment must not be delayed. Waiting for lab results can significantly worsen outcomes.\n\n4. The definitive management of myxedema coma is thyroid hormone replacement. Due to the risk of precipitating cardiac ischemia (especially in elderly patients), the recommended therapy is with levothyroxine rather than triiodothyronine (T3).\n\n5. Comparing the answer choices:\n\u2003\u2022 Option A (Free T4 level) and Option D (TSH level) are not sufficient on their own.\n\u2003\u2022 Option C (TSH and Free T4 level) would be appropriate for diagnostic confirmation under non-emergent conditions, but treatment should be started immediately in this critical scenario.\n\u2003\u2022 Option E (Triiodothyronine administration) carries a higher risk in the elderly.\n\u2003\u2022 Option B (Levothyroxine administration) is the correct treatment choice here.\n\nThus, the most appropriate next step in management is to begin thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine.\n\nFinal Answer: Levothyroxine administration.",
            "Step 1: Recognize the clinical scenario.\nThe 77\u2010year\u2010old man presents with severe hypothermia (88\u00b0F), bradycardia (35/min), hypotension, hypoventilation, altered mental status, and has a history of hypothyroidism. All these findings point to myxedema coma, a life\u2010threatening complication of severe hypothyroidism. An ECG showing bradycardia or conduction abnormalities further supports this diagnosis.\n\nStep 2: Review the initial management already provided.\nThe patient is being resuscitated with IV fluids, hydrocortisone (given before thyroid hormone replacement due to possible coexisting adrenal insufficiency), external warming, and norepinephrine for circulatory support. These interventions address the immediate hemodynamic instability. \n\nStep 3: Determine the next management step.\nIn myxedema coma, after initiating supportive care, the main treatment is thyroid hormone replacement. There is no delay in starting treatment with further diagnostics if the clinical suspicion is high. Although thyroid function tests (TSH and free T4 levels) are usually obtained, treatment should not be delayed. Among the choices provided, the direct administration of thyroid hormone is necessary, and the standard management is to initiate thyroid hormone replacement with IV levothyroxine.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate other options.\n\u2022 Option A (Free T4 level) and Option C (TSH and free T4 level) represent diagnostic evaluations, which although important, should not delay the initiation of therapy in an emergency setting.\n\u2022 Option D (TSH level) alone is inadequate for guiding immediate treatment.\n\u2022 Option E (Triiodothyronine administration) is not the preferred initial agent due to its cardiac side-effect profile, particularly in the elderly.\n\nThus, the most appropriate next step in management is to promptly start thyroid hormone replacement with IV levothyroxine.\n\nFinal answer: B.

            "Step 1: Identify the Clinical Picture\nThe 77-year-old man presents with severe hypothermia (88\u00b0F or 31.1\u00b0C), bradycardia (35/min), hypotension (92/62 mmHg), and decreased mental status. These findings, along with his sluggish but reactive pupils and his history of hypothyroidism, clearly point toward a crisis related to hypothyroidism\u2014namely, myxedema coma. Myxedema coma is an endocrine emergency that requires prompt treatment.\n\nStep 2: Review the Current Management\nThe patient has already received supportive care with intravenous fluids, hydrocortisone (to cover potential adrenal insufficiency), external warming, and norepinephrine for blood pressure support. The emergency physician has also obtained an ECG (likely showing bradycardia and possibly other features consistent with hypothyroidism).\n\nStep 3: Determine the Next Appropriate Action\nIn myxedema coma, although laboratory tests (i.e., TSH and free T4) are useful for confirmation, treatment must be initiated immediately because of the high mortality rate. Waiting for lab results would delay necessary intervention. The standard management involves thyroid hormone replacement\u2014with levothyroxine (T4) being the preferred agent. Administration of T3 is generally avoided due to its more potent cardiovascular effects, which can be risky in the elderly and those with compromised cardiac function.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate Incorrect Options\n\u2022 Option A (Free T4 level), Option C (TSH and free T4 level), and Option D (TSH level): Although these tests are important diagnostically, in the setting of myxedema coma, immediate treatment is paramount rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation.\n\u2022 Option E (Triiodothyronine administration): T3 is not the first-line treatment due to the potential for cardiac complications.\n\nStep 5: Final Answer\nThe most appropriate next step in management is to start thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine.\n\nFinal Answer: B.

An ECG is performed and incidentally demonstrates a bifascicular block, which is at high risk of progressing to a complete heart block.\n\nBifascular block is a conduction abnormality in 2 of the 3 fascicles that conduct electricity from atria to ventricles. This leaves conduction to the ventricles via the single remaining fascicle. There are different possibilities that may present on ECG. One possibility is a right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block; the other is a right bundle branch block with a left posterior fascicular block. Note that the pathophysiology of complete heart block is an inability to conduct electricity from the atria to the ventricles. If there is only 1 fascicle left to conduct electricity, the patient would be in complete heart block if this fascicle were to no longer work, which is a common outcome in patients with bifascicular block. Treatment of complete heart block involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nWiberg et al. discuss bifascicular block. They note the possible outcome of a complete heart block. It is recommended to look for this finding on ECG and appropriately workup patients to prevent progression of disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bifascicular block. Note the left axis deviation as suggested by the net upward deflection of the QRS in lead I and net downward deflection in lead II (blue arrows). Then, note the appearance of a right bundle branch block with the RSR pattern in aVR (black arrow) and upward R\u2019 in lead V1 (green arrow). This is a classic pattern for bifascicular block. Contrast this to the other pattern of bifascicular block which would present with a right bundle branch block and right axis deviation (upward QRS in lead II and downward in lead I), which was not seen in this case.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atrial fibrillation may occur secondary to aging, hypertension, or ischemia and presents with an irregularly irregular rate and rhythm with an absence of P waves. It may cause complications such as stroke. Management typically involves rate control agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction is a likely outcome in individuals with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, in particular, without proper preventive measures and medical therapy including statins, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors. This patient may be at risk of a myocardial infarction with his hypertension, and his underlying bifascicular block could suggest undiagnosed cardiac ischemia; however, it is more likely this patient progresses to complete heart block in the setting of his bifascicular block.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke is a possible complication of atrial fibrillation. For this reason, most patients with atrial fibrillation are on blood thinners to prevent this complication. It occurs secondary to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium. Patients are often risk stratified prior to starting blood thinners with tools such as CHADS2VASC and HASBLED. Isolated syncope is a rare manifestation of stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Torsades des pointes is a progression from QT prolongation which may occur secondary to genetic conditions, medications, and/or infection. It presents on ECG with QRS complexes that twist in amplitude around the electrical baseline. Treatment involves the administration of magnesium sulfate and, if needed, electrical cardioversion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA bifascicular block can progress to complete heart block.",

An ECG was obtained (Figure A), which \u2013 though not described in detail here \u2013 is meant to provide an important clue.\n\nStep 2: Think about why an ECG in a dehydrated patient on antihypertensive therapy might be significant. Patients with hypertension are often treated with diuretics. Dehydration, especially in someone taking diuretics, can lead to electrolyte imbalances (for example, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia). These electrolyte disturbances can prolong the QT interval.\n\nStep 3: Recognize that prolonged QT can predispose a patient to a specific, dangerous arrhythmia: Torsades de pointes. This life\u2010threatening ventricular arrhythmia is associated with a prolonged QT interval, and electrolyte abnormalities in the setting of dehydration or diuretic use is a common precipitant.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the multiple-choice options:\n\u2022 A. Atrial fibrillation \u2013 a common arrhythmia but not directly linked to a prolonged QT interval or the patient\u2019s current presentation.\n\u2022 B.

He lost consciousness for about 30 seconds. When he woke up, he was mildly confused but able to ski down the rest of the mountain. The patient initially denied medical treatment but his wife convinced him to be taken by ambulance to the emergency department for evaluation. The paramedics report that at the scene the patient had a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15. During the ride, he became gradually more somnolent. His medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and a prior transient ischemic attack. His medications include atorvastatin and lisinopril. In the emergency department, his temperature is 97.8\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 141/84 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 16/min. He is difficult to arouse with a GCS of 7.

        "reason": "This patient presents with a lucid interval followed by worsening somnolence and a biconvex lesion on head CT, which suggests a diagnosis of acute epidural hematoma. Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death. Patients with neurologic findings or those with expanding bleeds require urgent surgical decompression.\n\nDadashi et al. present cases of patients with epidural hematoma from acute trauma. They discuss how patients often sustain these injuries from extreme sports. They recommend being aware of this syndrome so that acute interventions can be taken.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates a biconvex hyperdensity that is limited by suture lines (red circle). This is the typical appearance of an epidural hematoma on head CT.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Damage to the cerebral bridging veins results in a subdural hematoma (SDH). An acute SDH more commonly presents with a gradual increase in headache and confusion rather than the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome presented in this vignette. However, a minority of patients with acute SDH may have a lucid interval followed by progressive neurological decline. SDH would have a crescent-shaped appearance on head CT rather than the biconvex appearance of an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer C: Occlusion of cerebral small penetrating arteries describes a lacunar stroke. Although this patient has 2 risk factors for lacunar stroke (hypertension and smoking), this patient\u2019s head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma.\n\nAnswer D: A ruptured cerebral aneurysm would most likely lead to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A subarachnoid hemorrhage presents as a sudden, severe headache (\u201cthunderclap headache\u201d), confusion or somnolence, nausea and vomiting, and meningismus. Surgical clipping or embolization of the bleeding vessel may be required.\n\nAnswer E: Secondary hemorrhage into a prior area of infarction usually occurs in the setting of a recent embolic stroke. Although this patient has a history of TIA and other risk factors for stroke, his head CT demonstrates an epidural hematoma. Treatment is supportive with the control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nBullet Summary:\nEpidural hematomas are caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery as it passes through the foramen spinosum of the sphenoid bone.",

            "Let\u2019s break down the key points:\n\n\u2022 The patient is a 54\u2010year\u2010old man who sustained blunt head trauma after colliding with a tree while skiing. He lost consciousness briefly (about 30 seconds), then appeared well (\u201clucid interval\u201d) before gradually deteriorating (GCS declining to 7).\n\n\u2022 This classic pattern\u2014a brief loss of consciousness, followed by a lucid period and then subsequent rapid decline\u2014is most often seen with an intracranial bleed. In head trauma, two types of extra-axial hematomas are common:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Epidural hematomas (EDH), which classically present with a lucid interval and rapid deterioration due to bleeding from an arterial source (most commonly the middle meningeal artery injured by a skull fracture near the pterion).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Subdural hematomas (SDH), which result from tearing of the cerebral bridging veins and typically have a more gradual onset of symptoms, though in severe cases they can also produce a lucid interval before rapid decline.\n\n\u2022 Although the \u201clucid interval\u201d is considered classic for epidural hematoma, the question does not list an option indicating arterial injury (i.e. rupture of the middle meningeal artery). Instead, among the answer choices the only option that directly relates to a traumatic bleed is:\n\n\u2003\u2003A. Damage to the cerebral bridging veins\n\n\u2022 Damage to the cerebral bridging veins is the cause of a subdural hematoma. In acute subdural hematoma, the bleeding (venous in origin) from these veins can accumulate rapidly and cause a marked decline in the level of consciousness. In the context of significant blunt head trauma, even though the classic \u201clucid interval\u201d is most often taught in epidural hematomas, an acute subdural hematoma can also present with a period of apparent normalcy before a rapid neurological decline.\n\n\u2022 The other options (damage to the sphenoid bone, occlusion of small cerebral arteries, ruptured aneurysm, and secondary hemorrhage into a previous infarct) are not consistent with the mechanism and evolution seen in this patient\u2019s post-traumatic scenario.\n\nTherefore, given the patient's trauma and subsequent clinical deterioration as well as the choices provided, the most likely cause of his presentation is damage to the cerebral bridging veins resulting in an acute subdural hematoma.\n\nFinal answer: A. Damage to the cerebral bridging veins.",
            "Step 1: Identify key clinical and imaging findings.\n\u2022 The patient had a head trauma (skiing accident with collision).\n\u2022 There was a brief loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval. This pattern is typical in certain intracranial hemorrhages.\n\u2022 Over the course of his transport, the patient deteriorated from a GCS of 15 to 7, suggesting a progressing intracranial process.\n\u2022 While the CT image isn\u2019t provided here, the described course is most consistent with a subdural hematoma.\n\nStep 2: Understand the pathophysiology.\n\u2022 Subdural hematomas occur due to tearing of the bridging veins that traverse between the cerebral cortex and the dural sinuses. They are particularly common in older patients and those on anticoagulation, but can occur after head trauma.\n\u2022 The lucid interval followed by a deterioration of mental status is a classic presentation of a subdural hematoma, where the slowly expanding collection of blood eventually increases intracranial pressure and causes symptoms.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the answer choices.\nA. Damage to the cerebral bridging veins \u2013 This is the mechanism behind subdural hematomas, which fits this patient\u2019s presentation.\nB. Damage to the sphenoid bone \u2013 This would not cause a subdural hematoma, and is more typically associated with issues in the skull base, not a hemorrhage.\nC.

Ruptured cerebral aneurysm \u2013 Typically causes a subarachnoid hemorrhage, not the pattern seen here.\nE.

            "Step 1: Recognize the classic presentation. The patient experienced a brief loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval and then progressive deterioration in his mental status. This sequence is classically seen in epidural hematomas.\n\nStep 2: Understand the mechanism. Epidural hematomas are most often caused by trauma that results in a skull fracture at the pterion\u2014a region where the frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones meet. Fracture at this location can injure the underlying middle meningeal artery.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the answer choices. Only one option alludes indirectly to the type of skull injury (option B, \u201cDamage to the sphenoid bone\u201d), which would be consistent with a fracture near the pterion leading to an epidural hematoma. The other choices refer to mechanisms that cause a subdural hematoma (damage to bridging veins), lacunar infarcts (small vessel occlusion), subarachnoid hemorrhage (ruptured aneurysm), or hemorrhagic transformation (secondary hemorrhage into infarcted tissue), none of which match the presentation.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the best answer. Given the clinical picture and typical trauma mechanism, the patient\u2019s presentation is most consistent with an epidural hematoma secondary to damage in the area of the sphenoid bone.\n\nFinal Answer: B.

A digital rectal exam may temporarily relieve the obstruction and lead to the expulsion of gas and stool (the \u201csquirt sign\u201d). Abdominal radiography typically demonstrates signs of distal intestinal obstruction such as proximal dilation and an absence of air in the rectum. Contrast enema may reveal a transition zone between the dilated proximal megacolon and the narrow rectosigmoid colon. A biopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with surgical removal of the defective segment of the bowel.\n\nKessman reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Hirschsprung disease.

Treatment is with the surgical opening of the atretic segment.\n\nAnswer C: Intestinal malrotation may preset with bilious vomiting in a neonate due to the development of a midgut volvulus. An abdominal radiograph may show the extension of the nasogastric tube into an abnormally positioned duodenum and would not show diffuse colonic distension. Treatment is with surgical derotation of the volvulus.\n\nAnswer D: Meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and also presents with delayed (> 48 hours) passing of meconium. The distal obstruction in these patients will not be temporarily relieved by a digital rectal exam. Contrast enema will demonstrate microcolon involving the entire large bowel.

        "reason": "This patient presents following a vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery with an ecchymotic swelling of the scalp that crosses the midline, which suggests a diagnosis of caput succedaneum. Caput succedaneum is caused by bleeding between the skin and the galea aponeurosis.\n\nCaput succedaneum is an uncommon extracranial injury that occurs during a traumatic birth, particularly in deliveries in which a vacuum-assist device is used. It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days. Treatment is supportive though patients may occasionally require phototherapy if they develop high levels of bilirubin. Transfusion is indicated if there is significant anemia present (though this is uncommon).\n\nJacob and Hoerter present evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with caput succedaneum. They discuss how this lesion commonly crosses cranial suture lines as well as the midline. They recommend differentiating this disease from more malignant etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Bleeding between the dura and arachnoid mater describes a subdural hematoma. Subdural hematomas are the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage found in neonates, but they usually present with more serious signs of respiratory depression, apnea, or seizures. Patients with a subdural hematoma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Treatment of expanding lesions may require surgical decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Bleeding between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis describes a subgaleal hemorrhage, an uncommon but serious complication of traumatic birth. Like caput succedaneum, subgaleal hemorrhages occur most commonly in newborns delivered via vacuum-assisted delivery, but the swelling in a subgaleal hemorrhage involves the entire scalp. Patients may also present with signs of extensive blood loss and neurological disturbances. Treatment involves resuscitation with fluids or blood and possibly neurosurgical intervention.\n\nAnswer C: Bleeding between the periosteum and skull describes a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematoma occurs in newborns and is caused by the rupture of the blood vessels crossing the periosteum. They are usually secondary to a prolonged second stage of labor and, unlike caput succedaneum, do not cross suture lines. The treatment for these lesions is supportive as most of these lesions resolve spontaneously.\n\nAnswer E: Bleeding into the lateral ventricles describes an intraventricular hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage is associated with premature delivery and usually presents with neurological symptoms. Neurologic findings include seizures, apnea, respiratory depression, or asymmetric reflexes. Treatment may involve urgent surgical decompression to prevent herniation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nCaput succedaneum is an extracranial injury caused by bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurotica in neonates.",

            "Step 1: Identify the condition. The newborn girl developed a scalp swelling a few hours after a vacuum-assisted delivery. The swelling is ecchymotic, noted over the parietal bones, and its size remains unchanged over serial measurements. This clinical picture is most consistent with a cephalohematoma, which is a subperiosteal hemorrhage resulting from birth trauma.\n\nStep 2: Understand the anatomy of a cephalohematoma. A cephalohematoma is located between the skull and its periosteum. Because the hematoma is subperiosteal, the blood is confined by the suture lines of the skull, preventing it from crossing over into adjacent areas. This confinement explains why the swelling does not change significantly in size over time.\n\nStep 3: Compare and eliminate incorrect choices.\n\u2022 Option A (Between dura and arachnoid mater) refers to a potential space where subdural hemorrhages may occur, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation.\n\u2022 Option B (Between periosteum and galea aponeurosis) describes a more superficial location than that of a cephalohematoma.\n\u2022 Option D (Between scalp and galea aponeurosis) is associated with caput succedaneum, a diffuse edematous swelling present at birth, which can cross suture lines and is not ecchymotic.\n\u2022 Option E (Into the lateral ventricles) would indicate an intraventricular hemorrhage, which is not supported by the clinical exam.\n\nStep 4: Final Answer\nThe newborn\u2019s scalp swelling (a cephalohematoma) most likely involves the potential space between the periosteum and the skull.\n\nFinal answer: Option C.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a preceding viral illness, dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus (blood pressure drop from 150/85 to 130/70 mmHg during inspiration), an echocardiogram with impaired diastolic filling, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG. This constellation of symptoms is concerning for constrictive pericarditis.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic. In contrast to other types of pericarditis, in constrictive pericarditis, there is impaired diastolic filling and thus impaired cardiac function. There are many possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis including infection, inflammatory conditions, or idiopathic. Patients will present with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, a pericardial friction rub, and positional chest pain (usually worsened by laying back and relieved by leaning forward). Patients may also demonstrate jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, worsening dyspnea, and congestive hepatopathy. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, and an echocardiogram will demonstrate impaired diastolic filling and may demonstrate a thickened pericardium. The diagnosis can be supported with pulsus paradoxus (a drop of blood pressure by > 10 mmHg during inspiration).\n\nWelch reviews constrictive pericarditis. He discusses constrictive pericarditis and how the inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling possibly causing unexplained heart failure. Welch notes making the diagnosis is very challenging and requires meticulous echocardiograph assessment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates diffuse ST elevation (blue arrows) with PR depression (black arrows). This is consistent with pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, in the setting of infection, or in the setting of autoimmune disease and is more likely to occur with a rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid. While pulsus paradoxus would be present in this condition, muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans would be more likely to be seen on ECG. Echocardiography would demonstrate an echogenic rim of fluid around the heart.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction presents with chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, and ST elevation in a vascular distribution. Note that this patient\u2019s ST elevation is diffuse and there is no reciprocal ST depression. Moreover, the pattern of chest pain in myocardial infarction is typically exertional and not positional.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary embolism may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, hemoptysis, a history of hypercoagulability, and recent stasis or surgery (such as this patient\u2019s recent Achilles tendon surgery). It can cause obstructive shock leading to hypotension and tachycardia. Note that right heart strain and sinus tachycardia would be seen on ECG.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents very similarly to restrictive pericarditis. Note that in restrictive cardiomyopathy, patients will also have impaired diastolic filling; however, it is due to a myocardium that will not expand rather than the pericardium impairing filling. It can occur secondary to conditions such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis as well as other chronic inflammatory states. The ECG findings are nonspecific but may include low voltage QRS complexes, ST segment changes, T wave changes, bundle branch blocks, and pathologic Q waves (abnormally deep and wide Q waves). The diagnosis can be supported with an ultrasound demonstrating impaired diastolic filling and possible myocardial speckling if a protein (amyloid) is present and deposited in the myocardial wall. The diagnosis can only definitively be confirmed with a biopsy which is highly invasive.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRestrictive pericarditis presents with chest pain that is positional, pulsus paradoxus, a friction rub, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG.",

The patient\u2019s blood pressure during inspiration is relatively stable (130/70 mmHg), arguing against tamponade.\n\u2022 Myocardial Infarction (Option C) would more likely feature chest pain and contractile dysfunction on echo, which are not present.\n\u2022 Pulmonary Embolism (Option D) usually presents with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. Despite the patient\u2019s risk factors (immobilization, obesity), his normal oxygen saturation and heart rate make PE less likely.\n\u2022 Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (Option E) also causes impaired diastolic filling with preserved contractility. However, it is usually due to infiltrative diseases (e.g., amyloidosis) and does not typically produce the pronounced jugular venous distension or the specific blood pressure dynamics seen here.\n\u2022 Constrictive Pericarditis (Option B) is characterized by impaired diastolic filling due to a thickened, noncompliant pericardium, resulting in signs of right-sided heart failure such as JVD. It often produces a characteristic finding during inspiration (e.g., a relatively fixed blood pressure and signs like the Kussmaul sign or a pericardial knock on exam) and echo typically shows a \u201cdip and plateau\u201d phenomenon with normal contractility.\n\nStep 3: Final Diagnosis\nGiven the echo finding of impaired diastolic filling with preserved ventricular contractility, the presence of jugular venous distension, and the absence of features typical for cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism, the most likely diagnosis is constrictive pericarditis.\n\nFinal answer: B.

Cardiac tamponade \u2013 It typically presents with dyspnea, jugular venous distension, and pulsus paradoxus (an exaggerated drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration). The echo in tamponade often demonstrates impaired diastolic filling due to pressure from fluid in the pericardial space, while contractility remains normal.  \nB. Constrictive pericarditis \u2013 This can cause impaired diastolic filling and JVD, but pulsus paradoxus is not a classic finding. Constrictive pericarditis usually follows a history of pericardial inflammation (e.g., TB, radiation) rather than a recent cold.  \nC. Myocardial infarction \u2013 Typically presents with chest pain and ECG changes reflecting ischemia, not with isolated diastolic filling impairment or pulsus paradoxus.  \nD. Pulmonary embolism \u2013 Often causes acute dyspnea and tachypnea with hypoxemia, but the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation is normal, and the echo would more likely show acute right ventricular strain rather than impaired diastolic filling.  \nE. Restrictive cardiomyopathy \u2013 While this condition presents with impaired diastolic filling and heart failure symptoms, it does not usually exhibit pulsus paradoxus, and the ventricular contractility is often abnormal over time due to myocardial infiltration.\n\nStep 3: Final reasoning and answer.  \nThe combination of symptoms (dyspnea, JVD), the significant drop in blood pressure on inspiration (pulsus paradoxus), and the echocardiographic findings (impaired diastolic filling with normal contractility) are most consistent with cardiac tamponade. \n\nFinal Answer: A.

Digoxin is an appropriate medication that can both control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation and increase cardiac contractility and potentially improve respiratory symptoms in this decompensated patient with heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation presents on ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. The initial management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate control. If the patient is stable, possible first-line agents include beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem). These agents may reduce cardiac contractility and worsen complications such as pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when the patient is in a decompensated state. If the patient has a reduced ejection fraction and requires rate control, then digoxin is a highly effective medication that blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should immediately be cardioverted.\n\nMoskowitz et. al review the management of atrial fibrillation. They note that in the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metoprolol is commonly used in the intensive care setting, is more successful than amiodarone, and had better rate control when compared to diltiazem.\n\nEhle et. al note that digoxin is approved to control ventricular response in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and is the only oral agent with positive inotropic effects approved for the management of mild to moderate heart failure.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating an irregularly irregular rate/rhythm (note the spacing of the blue arrows indicating the QRS complexes) without P waves, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Figure B is a chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral, hazy interstitial infiltrates, which are concerning for pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and prednisone would be appropriate management of a COPD flare, which presents in a patient with a history of smoking with dyspnea, wheezing, increased work of breathing, and a barrel chest. While this patient\u2019s wheezing may be secondary to his COPD, it is much more likely to be a cardiac wheeze given his chest radiograph findings including pulmonary edema. Treating his atrial fibrillation is more likely to alleviate his pulmonary symptoms. Other treatments in COPD include ipratropium and BiPAP.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem would be an appropriate rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of a COPD flare as it will not impair the mechanism of albuterol (which should be given as a nebulizer in COPD flares). In this patient, further impairing cardiac contractility with a calcium channel blocker may worsen his underlying pulmonary edema (given his reduced ejection fraction).\n\nAnswer D: Intubation would be indicated if this patient\u2019s respiratory status were worsening, including failure to oxygenate, failure to ventilate, or impending respiratory failure. This patient\u2019s respiratory status has improved on BiPAP; thus intubation is not needed.\n\nAnswer E: Metoprolol, like diltiazem, would reduce cardiac contractility and may worsen pulmonary edema, in particular, in a patient with a reduced ejection fraction. It also may cause COPD symptoms to emerge, as beta-2 blockade may cause bronchoconstriction (even though metoprolol is beta-1 selective). It would be indicated as outpatient rate control for a patient with atrial fibrillation who can tolerate a beta-blocker, and is preferred in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, as it reduces mortality.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with a reduced ejection fraction may be optimally managed with digoxin, which blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility.",

        "reason": "This postmenopausal patient is presenting with vulvovaginal dryness and irritation, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infections, likely due to genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). The most appropriate initial treatment is symptomatic relief with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.\n\nReduced estrogen levels after menopause lead to vulvovaginal atrophy by causing reduced blood flow and collagen content in vulvovaginal tissues. Patients typically have thin vulvar skin and loss of vaginal tissue pliability. The bladder and urethral epithelium may also atrophy leading to dysuria and urinary frequency. Atrophic tissue becomes thin, dry, and susceptible to injury. The first line of treatment is vaginal moisturizers and lubricants. If this does not improve symptoms, the next step in treatment is vaginal estrogen to help restore blood flow in vulvovaginal tissues. Finally, hormone replacement therapy is indicated if symptoms are refractory to all other modalities.\n\nBhupathiraju et al. studied the association between vaginal estrogen and chronic disease risk. The authors found no association between low-dose vaginal estrogen and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and hip fractures over an 18-year period. The authors recommended that low-dose vaginal estrogen can be used indefinitely without concomitant progestin therapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Metronidazole is the treatment for trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis. While patients with trichomoniasis can present with cervical petechiae and punctate hemorrhages, they typically also have frothy green discharge (absent in this patient). While patients with bacterial vaginosis can also have vaginal discharge, the discharge is typically malodorous and symptoms of pruritis are generally absent.\n\nAnswer B: Nitrofurantoin is the treatment of choice for urinary tract infections. While this patient has increased urinary frequency and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, her normal urinalysis makes the diagnosis of urinary tract infection unlikely.\n\nAnswer C: Topical clobetasol cream is the treatment for lichen sclerosis. While lichen sclerosis can present with pain with intercourse and vulvar pruritis, patients often have plaques that disrupt the normal vulvar architecture. Lichen sclerosis does not affect the vaginal tissues.\n\nAnswer D: Topical estrogen is the treatment of choice for cases of vulvovaginal atrophy resistant to treatment with vaginal moisturizers and lubricants.

        "reason": "This patient's progressively increasing PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex on ECG is consistent with second degree atrioventricular (AV) block, Mobitz type I, also referred to as Wenckebach phenomenon.\n\nSecond degree AV block, Mobitz type I can occur in a variety of settings, such as in the context of digoxin, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or increased vagal tone. On ECG, there is progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex (a dropped beat); then, the PR interval resets. Patients are typically asymptomatic, but should undergo evaluation for an underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia, such as electrolyte imbalances, medication side effect, or structural heart disease, as well as a follow-up ECG to evaluate for any progression. If the dysrhythmia is caused by medication, the offending agent should be discontinued, but otherwise there are no specific treatments necessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic and hemodynamically stable can undergo telemetry monitoring and receive atropine with limited efficacy. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and not responsive to atropine may need cardiac pacing. Generally, there is a low risk of progression to third degree AV block, and a pacemaker is rarely required (in contrast to second degree heart block type II).\n\nBarold and Hayes review second-degree heart block. They note the changes in AV node conduction time on ECG in this condition. They recommend using the correct definition of the different heart blocks for the correct underlying treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG showing PR intervals that gradually prolong until a P wave is seen not followed by a QRS complex (note the blue bars that show the progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until the dropped beat).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: First degree AV block is seen on ECG with prolonged PR intervals greater than 0.2 sec, but a consistent 1:1 ratio of P waves to QRS complexes. This finding is typically found in younger patients with increased vagal tone or in athletes, and does not require treatment.\n\nAnswer C: Second degree AV block, Mobitz type II is seen with fixed PR intervals and occasional dropped QRS complexes. Patients with Mobitz II sometimes present with syncope and frequently progress to third degree AV block. This finding may be associated with fibrotic changes to the conduction system or from acute, subacute, or prior myocardial infarction, and should be treated with placement of a pacemaker in most cases.\n\nAnswer D: Sinus bradycardia findings on ECG include normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Patients with sinus bradycardia may be asymptomatic, but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness, chest pain, or hypotension. No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic, but atropine may be given to increase the heart rate in symptomatic cases. Pacemaker placement is required for patients with chronic symptoms.\n\nAnswer E: Third-degree AV block occurs when the atria and ventricles depolarize independently on ECG. There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. Patients may present with syncope, dizziness, acute heart failure, or hypotension. The treatment is pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSecond degree atrioventricular block, Mobitz type I, is characterized by progressively lengthening PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex.",

In hemodynamically stable patients with a relative contraindication to \u03b2-blockers (COPD on home oxygen with increasing oxygen need), rate control with a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as verapamil is preferred.\n\nAtrial fibrillation can present with palpitations, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. ECG findings will be an irregularly irregular rhythm and absent P waves with an erratic baseline as shown in Illustration A. Treatment is centered on rate control. First-line agents for rate control include \u03b21 selective blockers (metoprolol and esmolol) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem). In patients with COPD, non-selective \u03b2-blockers (propranolol, timolol, and sotalol) can worsen bronchoconstriction by activating \u03b22-adrenoreceptors. Other relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers include Raynaud disease and depression (increased risk of fatigue and sexual dysfunction). In patients with relative contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred initial treatment option.\n\nVan Gelder et al. studied lenient (resting heart rate < 110 beats per minute) versus strict rate control (resting heart rate < 80 beats per minute) in patients with atrial fibrillation in a randomized control trial. The authors found that there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, bleeding, and life-threatening arrhythmias between the 2 groups. The authors recommend a lenient rate control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG lacking P waves (red arrows) and irregularly irregular RR intervals (red/blue lines), which are classic findings in atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic that can be used in patients to convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. It is often suitable to use in patients with depressed left ventricular function. Amiodarone has multiple multi-system adverse effects including pulmonary toxicity, and it is not used as a first-line agent.\n\nAnswer B: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent that can be used to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Although patients with atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, the preferred anticoagulation agents are warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban).\n\nAnswer C: Digoxin can be used as a rate control agent in atrial fibrillation as it directly suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction. Due to its narrow therapeutic window and risk of toxicity, it is used as second-line therapy when first-line agents fail.\n\nAnswer D: Metoprolol is a \u03b2-blocker that is a first-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. In patients with contraindications to \u03b2-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the treatment of choice.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with sudden onset confusion, slurred speech, asymmetric smile, and weakness in the setting of risk factors for stroke (atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and hypertension). The most important initial step in management in a patient with altered mental status and neurological deficits is to obtain a fingerstick blood glucose.\n\nThe workup of stroke is first centered on a thorough history and physical and immediately calculating an NIH stroke scale (11-domain assessment of stroke severity involving patient consciousness level, orientation, ability to follow commands, degree of gaze palsy, degree of vision loss, ataxia, motor drift, sensation, inattention, language/speech) as well as ascertaining when the patient was last known to be neurologically normal. While performing the exam and NIH stroke scale, a fingerstick blood glucose should be performed in all patients as hypoglycemia may present identically to a stroke. Severe hypoglycemia may present with lethargy, confusion, focal or global weakness, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and even seizures. If the patient is hypoglycemic, dextrose can be given which will rapidly correct the patient's underlying deficits.\n\nOhshita et al. review other possible causes of stroke-like symptoms. They note that hypoglycemia may mimic stroke and cause focal neurological signs with common findings being unilateral motor weakness with mild or moderate alteration of consciousness. They noted that all patients improved within 1 hour of glucose injection in this study, thus the recommendation to check a fingerstick blood glucose in all stroke patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alteplase would be indicated if a patient presented with disabling neurologic deficits from an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset only after a CT scan of the head has ruled out an intracranial bleed. The patient must have no other contraindications to thrombolytics including but not limited to recent trauma, known intracranial hemorrhage, rapidly improving neurologic deficits (spontaneously), and no other clear reversible cause (among many other contraindications).\n\nAnswer B: CT head is the most appropriate initial step in the management of an acute stroke; however, a rapid fingerstick blood glucose takes precedence as hypoglycemia can mimic a stroke and be immediately addressed thus removing the need for further workup if there is a complete resolution of symptoms with normoglycemia. While an exam is ongoing, a fingerstick blood glucose is being obtained, and neuroimaging is also often ordered to be performed immediately after.\n\nAnswer D: Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K would be indicated in this patient if he had a hemorrhagic stroke (a CT of the head would need to confirm this) to reverse his anticoagulation with warfarin. Factor concentrate can also be used to rapidly reverse anticoagulation with warfarin.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain would be indicated in the workup of a stroke or transient ischemic attack after all emergency interventions and labs including CT head, serum chemistries, CBC, and ECG. It delineates the extent of the stroke and gives useful prognostic and diagnostic information. It also may elucidate strokes missed on other forms of neuroimaging such as CT perfusion.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA fingerstick blood glucose should be obtained immediately in all patients with stroke-like symptoms or altered mental status.",

The most common and rapid way to do this is by obtaining a noncontrast CT scan of the head, which can effectively detect any intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nStep 3: While checking fingerstick blood glucose is often performed early in the evaluation of altered mental status to rule out hypoglycemia (which can mimic stroke), in this case the clinical picture strongly suggests a neurologic event. The CT head is the key step to differentiate between an ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke before considering thrombolytic therapy with alteplase.\n\nStep 4: Options such as administering alteplase immediately (without imaging) or MRI brain would not be appropriate prior to excluding hemorrhage, especially given the patient's warfarin use, which raises concerns about bleeding risk. Fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K are used to reverse warfarin effect in the setting of hemorrhage, but there is no indication of intracranial bleeding without imaging confirmation.\n\nFinal Answer: CT head"

        "reason": "This patient with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, deviation of the tongue to the right, left-sided hemiparesis, and decreased sensation to light touch and vibration on the left side of his body most likely has a stroke of the right medial medulla. The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation. Treatment includes reperfusion via thrombolytics if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of the time last known well.\n\nKim and Han present clinical findings, radiographic findings, angiographic data, and long-term outcomes from a case series of 86 patients with medial medullary infarction. The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome). This leads to lesions to the nucleus ambiguus, vestibular nuclei, lateral spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Clinically this presents with dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased gag reflex, vomiting, vertigo, decreased pain and temperature sensation from the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, and ipsilateral ataxia.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOcclusion of the anterior spinal artery can lead to medial medullary syndrome, which presents with ipsilateral deviation of the tongue, contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities, and contralateral loss of light touch and vibration sensation.",

Patients classically present with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Atypical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction may include abdominal pain, nausea, reflux symptoms, and dizziness. The most important initial step in management is to administer aspirin as it lowers mortality and carries minimal risk. An ECG should then be performed. Classically, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will demonstrate ST elevations in a vascular distribution. However, the progression to a STEMI is usually stepwise and may present with ST depressions, hyperacute T waves, pseudonormalization of the ST segment (a normal ST segment after a depression as it elevates), ST elevations, and finally tombstoning (a concave down wave that looks like a tombstone). If a STEMI is suspected after an ECG is performed, the patient should be started on a second antiplatelet agent (e.g., ticagrelor), heparin, and sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\nNable et al. review the typical electrophysiologic changes found in STEMI. The authors note that T-wave inversions and ST-segment depression can before, during, or after the STEMI event. The authors recommend obtaining serial ECGs in patients with suspected STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates hyperacute T waves (blue arrows) that are only occurring in a vascular distribution (V2-V6).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia can present with peaked T waves; however, peaked T waves would be demonstrated in all leads. Other findings of hyperkalemia can include QRS widening. Immediate management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes should include calcium administration followed by drugs that shift potassium intracellularly such as insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate. Further management may include diuresis and/or dialysis.\n\nAnswer B: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may demonstrate increased voltages throughout the ECG, in particular, in leads V2-V6 with deep Q waves in the septal leads. It may present with syncope upon exertion in a young patient (and in rare cases, sudden cardiac death). Ultrasound would show hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Management involves staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activities, and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Hypokalemia can present initially on ECG with U waves and may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias. Repletion with potassium is the preferred treatment, and the magnesium level should be checked as low magnesium can lead to potassium wasting in the kidneys.\n\nAnswer E: Pericarditis presents with chest pain worse by laying back and relieved by leaning forward. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions, and echocardiography may demonstrate a pericardial effusion. Management involves the administration of ibuprofen or colchicine and steroids in refractory cases.

Hyperkalemia \u2013 Typically produces peaked T waves and other characteristic ECG changes but is not usually associated with positional chest pain.\nB. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy \u2013 May present with exertional chest pain and syncope; however, the pain is not classically relieved by leaning forward.\nC. Hypokalemia \u2013 Can cause various ECG changes, such as flattened T waves and U waves, but does not produce positional chest pain.\nD. Myocardial infarction \u2013 A strong consideration in someone with risk factors; however, MI chest pain is not generally improved by leaning forward. Additionally, the ECG in MI generally shows localized ST elevations with reciprocal depressions rather than the diffuse changes of pericarditis.\nE. Pericarditis \u2013 Notably presents with chest pain that worsens when lying down (or leaning back) and improves when sitting up or leaning forward. ECG findings in pericarditis classically include diffuse ST segment elevations and PR depressions.\n\nStep 3: Compare and Eliminate Incorrect Options\n\u2022 Hyperkalemia and hypokalemia can be ruled out because they are primarily diagnosed based on their specific ECG changes, which are different from the diffuse ST elevations seen in pericarditis.\n\u2022 Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is less likely given the positional nature of the chest pain.\n\u2022 While myocardial infarction remains in the differential for chest pain in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors, the classic positional improvement (leaning forward) and likely corresponding ECG findings (as suggested by the provided figure) point away from MI.\n\u2022 Pericarditis perfectly fits the unique symptom of pain improvement when leaning forward along with the typical ECG findings.\n\nStep 4: Final Answer\nBased on the positional chest pain, the timeframe, and the expected ECG findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nFinal answer: E.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of retinal vein occlusion.\n\nRetinal vein occlusion can occur in either central or branch retinal veins and is often caused by compression from nearby arterial atherosclerosis. It presents as acute onset, painless vision loss, normally in one eye. On fundoscopic exam, classic findings of this disease include venous engorgement, retinal hemorrhage, cotton wool exudates, and edema/swelling of the optic disk can be seen. There is no definitive treatment for this disorder but symptomatic treatment includes intravitreal glucocorticoid injections and retinal laser photocoagulation. Retinal vein occlusion may resolve spontaneously or progress to permanent vision loss.\n\nRobinson and Halpern present evidence regarding the treatment of retinal vein occlusion. They discuss how the treatments for the acute phase of this disease have been disappointing. They recommend managing long-term complications such as neovascularization with phototherapy.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a fundoscopic exam showing engorged retinal veins, optic disk swelling, and widespread retinal hemorrhages (red circle). These findings are characteristic of central retinal vein occlusion.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Central retinal artery occlusion can present as sudden onset, unilateral vision loss.

Embolic sources may include carotid artery atherosclerosis or cardiac vegetation. Treatment is with risk factor control.\n\nAnswer B: Closed-angle glaucoma presents as sudden, painful, vision loss caused by increased intraocular pressure. The eye will appear red and often feel \u201chard.\u201d The optic disc will show characteristic cupping. Intraocular pressure will be levated and treatment is with acetazolamide, steroids, timolol, bromidine, and pilocarpine. Irodotomy is reserved for refractory cases.\n\nAnswer C: Papilledema may present as an enlargement in the blind spot and is usually bilateral, as it is caused by increased intracranial pressure.

In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective. Of note, his blood pressure currently is not very elevated nor is it causing end-organ dysfunction.\n\nAnswer E: MRI brain should be performed to further characterize whether there was any ischemic injury to the brain; however, this usually will occur after a CTA head/neck and certainly after the patient receives an aspirin. It can more accurately characterize if a stroke occurred, and the extent of the injury.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe workup of a transient ischemic attack should be centered on a thorough neurological exam, a non-contrast CT scan of the head, and administration of aspirin assuming there is no intracranial bleed.",

Episodes of painless hematuria are commonly seen in these patients.\n\nSickle cell trait is a condition that refers to carrying 1 normal and 1 abnormal beta-globin allele. On electrophoresis, this will present as 3 different bands consisting of about 50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin). HbF decreases significantly after the first 6 weeks of life. Individuals with sickle cell trait tend to be asymptomatic and do not have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population. However, they are at higher risk of some conditions. Patients are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous physical activity and may have episodic painless hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis. The hyperosmolar, acidotic, and hypoxic environment of the renal medulla is thought to trigger red cell sickling which results in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. Patients with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. These patients should receive reproductive counseling and use appropriate preventive measures to prevent dehydration during intensive exercise.\n\nHulsizer et al. studied the association between sickle cell trait and common medical conditions using insurance claims data. The authors found that sickle cell trait is associated with increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and retinopathy. The authors recommend further evaluation of these associations using prospective studies derived from clinical data.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows gel electrophoresis with an example of a normal (95-98% HbA and < 2% HbF), sickle cell trait (50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF), and sickle cell anemia (85-95% HbS and 5-15% HbF) patient from left to right.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Diabetes has not been associated with sickle cell trait in the majority of studies.\n\nAnswer C: Infection is a complication of sickle cell anemia. Mechanisms include functional asplenism, reduced tissue perfusion during a sickle crisis, and chronic transfusions with an indwelling catheter. Common infections include bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitis. Sickle cell trait is not clearly associated with an increased risk of infection and actually confers some protection against malaria.\n\nAnswer D: Splenectomy from auto-infarction is often seen in sickle cell anemia, but it is rare with sickle cell trait. In sickle cell anemia, splenic sequestration of sickled red blood cells causes infarction, leading to progressive atrophy and functional hyposplenism. Most individuals with sickle cell disease are functionally asplenic by age 2 to 4. The spleen subsequently cannot phagocytose encapsulated organisms properly, which predisposes sickle cell patients to infection.\n\nAnswer E: Stroke is a complication of sickle cell anemia but not sickle cell trait.

The abnormal newborn screen (as well as the pedigree in which the uncle died of sickle cell anemia) supports this diagnosis.\n\nStep 2: Consider classic complications of sickle cell disease. Children with sickle cell disease may develop vaso-occlusive events that can affect multiple organ systems. Two well-known complications are stroke (from occlusion of cerebral vessels) and splenic sequestration with eventual autosplenectomy (leading to risk of infections). Other complications include hematuria from renal papillary necrosis. Diabetes is not typically associated with sickle cell disease.\n\nStep 3: Among the options provided:\n\u2022 Diabetes is not linked to sickle cell disease.\n\u2022 Hematuria (although it can occur due to sickling in the renal medulla) is less frequently a major complication.\n\u2022 Infection risk is increased as a result of functional asplenia from repeated splenic infarcts, but prophylactic measures help reduce this risk.\n\u2022 Splenectomy (as a surgical procedure) is not usually performed since patients undergo autosplenectomy from repeated infarcts.\n\u2022 Stroke, particularly in children, is a well-known devastating complication of sickle cell disease.\n\nStep 4: Based on typical progression and the high incidence of cerebrovascular events in children with sickle cell disease, stroke is the most likely complication this patient may experience in the future.\n\nFinal Answer: E.

            "Step 1: The patient\u2019s newborn screen and family history (with both parents being carriers and a paternal uncle who died from sickle cell anemia) are highly suggestive of sickle cell disease. His hemoglobin electrophoresis results (Figure A, which we assume shows nearly all hemoglobin S with some fetal hemoglobin) are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nStep 2: Consider the complications commonly seen in sickle cell disease. Children with sickle cell disease typically develop repeated vaso\u2010occlusive episodes causing infarctions in various organs. In the spleen, repeated infarctions can lead to autosplenectomy (i.e. a functional loss of the spleen) by about age 5, which makes these children more susceptible to encapsulated organisms. Stroke is also a known complication in sickle cell disease, though it affects a somewhat lower percentage of patients. Diabetes is not recognized as a complication of sickle cell disease. Hematuria may occur due to renal papillary infarctions, but it is much less common than splenic complications. \u201cInfection\u201d could be considered given the risk from functional asplenia, but the process of autosplenectomy is a near-universal finding in sickle cell disease.\n\nStep 3: Given these options, the most likely complication that this patient will develop in the future is repeated splenic infarctions leading to functional asplenia (commonly referred to as splenectomy in this context). \n\nFinal Answer: D.

        "reason": "This young, healthy patient is presenting with constant vertigo, ataxia, vomiting, and a head impulse test revealing a corrective saccade, nystagmus, and test of skew (HINTS) exam, which suggests a peripheral etiology of vertigo, most likely vestibular neuritis. As the diagnosis can be made clinically, steroids are the only treatment needed.\n\nDifferentiating peripheral (the vestibular system) versus central (the brain) vertigo is critical in management. Peripheral vertigo is commonly caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis. Vertigo that is constant is more consistent with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis but could also be a cerebellar stroke. To differentiate, age, risk factors, and onset of symptoms are critical. Moreover, the HINTS exam can point toward 1 cause of vertigo versus another. HINTS is a mnemonic for: Horizontal head impulse testing (Head Impulse), Direction-changing nystagmus in eccentric gaze (Nystagmus), and Vertical skew (Test of Skew). Findings that are suggestive of a peripheral cause of vertigo include a positive head impulse exam, positive nystagmus (also seen in stroke), and a negative test of skew. In the appropriate clinical context with appropriate risk factors, peripheral causes such as vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis can be managed with steroids (which may improve outcomes) and meclizine (for symptom control).\n\nKattah et al. discuss the HINTS exam. They note how it can be used to differentiate peripheral from central vertigo. It is recommended to perform this exam when differentiating central versus peripheral vertigo.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswers 1 & 3: Head imaging such as a CT head or MRI brain is not necessary in patients with a clear peripheral cause of their vertigo/dizziness with a HINTS exam suggesting a peripheral etiology. Clinically, this patient has vestibular neuritis and can be treated accordingly. Imaging would be needed if the patient had an acute cerebellar stroke.\n\nAnswer D: The Epley maneuver is only indicated in cases of benign paroxysmal peripheral vertigo, which presents with severe vertigo (with changes in head position) that diminish with time and keeping the head stationary. Note that this patient\u2019s Dix-Hallpike maneuver is negative and that his vertigo is constant rather than intermittent or positional.\n\nAnswer E: Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated within 4.5 hours in the setting of an ischemic stroke after a head CT rules out a head bleed, other reversible causes are treated, and assuming there are no contraindications to thrombolytics. Tissue plasminogen activator can be given in posterior circulation strokes.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPeripheral causes of vertigo generally do not require head imaging, and causes such as labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis can be treated with steroids.",

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis. They discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis. They further detail complications that may arise such as hyperkalemia, and discuss respective management strategies.\n\nFigure A demonstrates an electrocardiogram with features characteristic of hyperkalemia. Note the peaked appearance of the T waves in the precordial leads.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and IV fluid resuscitation may eventually be appropriate. Albuterol (a beta agonist) will act to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment. This patient's electrocardiogram changes warrant immediate treatment with calcium gluconate in order to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes.\n\nAnswer C: Insulin, glucose, and IV fluid resuscitation are indicated in this patient. Insulin acts to shift potassium to the intracellular compartment, and fluid resuscitation is warranted for the patient's likely renal impairment. Calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer D: IV fluid resuscitation is indicated for this patient with likely renal impairment. However, calcium gluconate is the more immediate priority to address this patient's hyperkalemia and prevent development of arrhythmia.\n\nAnswer E: Sodium polystyrene is an oral potassium binder that increases GI excretion of potassium. It may be appropriate to treat mild hyperkalemia in some patients. It takes a prolonged amount of time to have any significant effect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on ECG, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.",

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs in almost all patients with MEN2B and is often metastatic at the time of diagnosis. Patients should be screened for pheochromocytoma using plasma fractionated metanephrines at the time of diagnosis of MTC.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after a myocardial infarction for a follow-up appointment. The most appropriate next step in management is to start an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as lisinopril.\n\nWhen a patient experiences a myocardial infarction, there are certain medications that the patient should be started on that lower mortality. These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced. Of note, ACE inhibitors also reduce mortality in diabetes by decreasing hyperfiltration damage to the glomeruli.\n\nJering et al. hypothesized that using an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor would improve mortality in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction. They discuss how an ACE inhibitor is the standard of care in patients currently. They recommend performing a randomized controlled trial comparing these treatment modalities.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an ECG with ST elevation (red circles) in leads II, III, and AVF. These ST elevations are indicative of a STEMI.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hydrochlorothiazide can be used to manage this patient's blood pressure; however, this drug does not lower mortality like an ACE inhibitor. In the setting of patients with myocardial infarctions, inhibition of detrimental ventricular remodeling is key for lowering mortality.\n\nAnswer C: Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to reduce blood pressure; however, it does not reduce mortality in patients who have experienced an MI. Calcium channel blockers tend to have few side effects and can be safely started in most patients.\n\nAnswer D: Continuing current medications and scheduling a follow-up appointment misses the opportunity for the patient to be started on a mortality-lowering ACE inhibitor. In patients who are amenable to starting a new medication, an ACE inhibitor should be administered to all patients who have sustained an MI.\n\nAnswer E: Switching to carvedilol would be unnecessary and not likely to benefit this patient as much as adding an ACE inhibitor. Metoprolol is the preferred beta blocker in patients who have sustained an MI. In the absence of idiosyncratic side effects, there is no indication to use another beta blocker.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients who have experienced a myocardial infarction should be discharged on mortality-lowering drugs such as aspirin, beta-blockers, anti-platelet agents, and ACE inhibitors.",

        "reason": "This patient's mood changes and findings concerning for subacute combined degeneration (fall in the dark, impaired proprioception, weakness, and brisk patellar reflexes), and history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery are concerning for vitamin B12 deficiency. Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The authors find that vitamin B12 deficiency was significantly higher in patients with RYGB compared with sleeve gastrectomy. The authors recommend adherence to supplemental iron and vitamin intake in all patients who undergo bariatric surgery.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Poor iron absorption is a well-known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery due to bypass of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Poor iron absorption leads to microcytic anemia from iron deficiency and presents with generalized fatigue and conjunctival pallor. Iron deficiency anemia would not present with brisk reflexes and impaired proprioception.\n\nAnswer B: Prior Treponema pallidum exposure can result in tabes dorsalis, a neurological complication of syphilis, and is seen in patients with a history of multiple sexual partners who do not use barrier protection. The spirochete leads to disease in the posterior columns (vibration and proprioception sensation). Patients present with sensory ataxia (similar to subacute combined degeneration), lancinating pain (in the limbs, back, or face), and an Argyll-Robertson pupil (impaired pupillary constriction to light but intact pupillary constriction to accommodation).\n\nAnswer C: Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin are seen in patients with major depressive disorder which does not cause sensory ataxia with brisk reflexes.\n\nAnswer E: Subtherapeutic levothyroxine dose would result in hypothyroidism, which can present with depressed mood, cold intolerance, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Roux-en-Y is an effective means of losing weight, and as the body mass decreases with weight loss, the required dose of levothyroxine is decreased. It would not present with the abnormal neurologic findings seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRoux-en-Y bariatric surgery increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency via reduction of food intake, decreased functional parietal cell count, and reduced absorption of vitamin B12 (which may cause subacute combined degeneration).",

Prior Treponema pallidum exposure \u2013 Neurosyphilis is unlikely given her history and presentation.\nC. Reduced central nervous system dopamine and serotonin \u2013 This describes the pathophysiology of primary depression; however, it does not account for her neurological findings (4/5 strength and brisk reflexes) or the risk related to her surgical history.\nD. Reduced functional parietal cell count \u2013 This is directly related to her history of gastric bypass. The reduction in stomach tissue\u2014and specifically parietal cells\u2014leads to decreased intrinsic factor secretion, impairing vitamin B12 absorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause both mood changes and neurological findings, matching her clinical picture.\nE.

Reduced functional parietal cell count \u2013 This is directly related to her history of gastric bypass. The reduction in stomach tissue\u2014and specifically parietal cells\u2014leads to decreased intrinsic factor secretion, impairing vitamin B12 absorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause both mood changes and neurological findings, matching her clinical picture.\nE.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with a pattern of chest pain (pressure and diaphoresis) that is highly concerning for an acute myocardial infarction. This patient initially has ST depressions (in triage) followed by ST segment normalization and possibly hyperacute T waves which raises concern for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring frequent ECGs to determine if a STEMI evolves.\n\nA STEMI presents with crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among many other possible presentations. When a patient presents with symptoms concerning for a STEMI, aspirin should be administered and an ECG should be performed. Early in a myocardial infarction, ST depressions with hyperacute T waves may be present. As the infarction evolves, the T waves may become more acute and the ST segment will begin to elevate. There may be a brief period of pseudonormalization where the ST segment appears to be normal. If the patient appears better, this can be reassuring. However, ongoing chest pain in the setting of these findings raises concern for pseudonormalization of the ST segment (an ST segment that is going to continue to rise). Nitroglycerin can be administered to see if the patient can become chest pain-free, and serial ECGs should be performed to determine if a STEMI is present. If symptoms resolve and the ECG is stable, this is reassuring and medical optimization and an elective catheterization may be performed. If the ECG evolves into a STEMI, then cardiac catheterization is indicated emergently.\n\nDaga et al. discuss STEMI and its workup. They note the ECG manifestations, and the pathophysiology in addition to the appropriate workup of acute coronary syndrome. They recommend aspirin and catheterization in an acute STEMI.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates an initial ECG with ST depression (blue arrows) followed by pseudonormalization of the ST segment (green arrows) and possibly hyperacute T waves (black arrows), which are concerning for ischemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac catheterization may be required in this patient; however, if the patient\u2019s chest pain improves or if the troponin is negative, it is unlikely he is having an acute myocardial infarction requiring immediate catheterization. Repeating the ECG will allow for triaging of the patient and will aid in determining if emergency cardiac catheterization is needed.\n\nAnswer B: Chest radiography is appropriate in the workup of chest pain as it can rule out diagnoses such as pneumothorax or may suggest diagnoses such as an aortic dissection (type A) if there is a widened mediastinum. In this patient, the ST segment changes and characteristic history make acute coronary syndrome a more likely diagnosis, and while a chest radiograph should be performed at some point, repeating the ECG is a more dire initial step in management.\n\nAnswer C: CK-MB level could be helpful in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred as it elevates rapidly and also decreases fairly rapidly. This makes it useful when diagnosing a new myocardial infarction after a recent infarction as the troponin may still be elevated from the previous infarction. This patient has no history of recent myocardial infarction, and a repeat ECG is more dire to determine if this patient needs emergent intervention. Of note, the decision for emergent catheterization should not wait on cardiac biomarkers.\n\nAnswer D: Heparin should not be given empirically to patients in chest pain. It does not necessarily decrease mortality but does increase the risk of bleeding. It is often given to patients with an NSTEMI.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPseudonormalization occurs when an ST depression begins to elevate and appears normal in the setting of a myocardial infarction, requiring close monitoring and serial ECGs to ensure that a ST elevation myocardial infarction does not occur.",

In the setting of his diabetic neuropathy (lower extremity burning pain in the setting of poorly managed diabetes), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) such as venlafaxine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\n\nMajor depressive disorder should always initially be managed with cognitive behavioral therapy and often medication. Typically, the first-line medication is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). However, SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine are viable first-line options. They are particularly preferred in patients with diabetic neuropathy as they treat both diabetic neuropathy and depression. SNRIs are also generally considered to be less sedating than SSRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are often a better initial drug in depression than SSRIs in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy.\n\nSansone and Sansone discuss SNRIs and their uses. They discuss how there are different efficacies and propensities of the different SNRIs. They recommend choosing an appropriate SNRI based on the patient's needs and comorbidities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression in patients who also suffer from other neuropathic pain conditions or conditions such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome. While it may also be used in diabetic neuropathy and depression, there is higher toxicity with this medication than SNRIs. For this reason, SNRIs are preferred. A TCA might be appropriate if the patient had already failed other first-line agents.\n\nAnswer B: Bupropion is a weight-neutral antidepressant that can be used in smoking cessation and patients who are trying to avoid the sexual side effects of SSRIs (anorgasmia). It would not address this patient's diabetic neuropathy, though it could be beneficial for his obesity.\n\nAnswer C: Escitalopram is an SSRI that could be used first-line for major depressive disorder. However, if a patient has a concomitant condition, it is better to choose a single agent that addresses both problems; thus, SNRIs are better first-line medications in this patient with diabetic neuropathy.\n\nAnswer D: Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor that can be used in atypical depression or as a third-line or later agent in the management of depression. This agent can cause a hypertensive crisis in the setting of tyramine consumption, has many medication interactions, and a long washout period. Thus, it is not usually a first or second-line agent. However, it is highly effective in patients who have failed other first-line agents and should still be used in appropriate candidates.\n\nBullet Summary:\nSNRIs are appropriate first-line agents for major depressive disorder in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting after a suicide attempt with an unknown overdose and is confused, febrile, tachycardic, and has QRS widening on ECG. This combination of symptoms is highly concerning for a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose which can cause an anticholinergic toxidrome and urinary retention.\n\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were once a mainstay in the treatment of depression before the advent of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). They are sometimes still used for depression and neuropathic pain. In overdose, TCAs block sodium channels in the heart and cause a pathognomonic QRS widening. Sodium bicarbonate should be administered until the QRS duration normalizes. TCAs also have anticholinergic properties and can cause an anticholinergic toxidrome including delirium, confusion, constipation, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, dry, warm, and flushed skin, and fever. Although physostigmine is typically the antidote of choice for an anticholinergic toxidrome, it is avoided in TCA toxicity due to the theoretical concern for inducing a cardiac arrest.\n\nUrquhart et al. studied the utility of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of chronic lower back pain. They found no significant difference in pain reduction compared to placebo. They recommend further study of the potential benefits of TCAs, independent of sleep improvement, for the treatment of lower back pain.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating QRS widening (note how long the red lines are which demarcate the QRS duration) which is highly concerning for TCA overdose.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Diaphoresis, tachycardia, increased bowel sounds, and agitation would be seen in a sympathomimetic toxidrome from drugs like cocaine or amphetamines. Rather, dry, flushed skin would be seen in an anticholinergic toxidrome.\n\nAnswer B: Jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain would be seen in acetaminophen overdose which can cause fulminant liver failure. It is also possible that patients may initially be asymptomatic in acetaminophen overdose, and a high level of suspicion must be maintained for this diagnosis. A serum acetaminophen level should be drawn in any patient suspected of overdose.\n\nAnswer C: Miosis, bradypnea, decreased bowel sounds, and somnolence would be seen in an opioid toxidrome. Rather, dilated and minimally responsive pupils would be seen in an anticholinergic toxidrome.\n\nAnswer D: Wheezing, bronchorrhea, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, confusion, and drooling would be seen in a cholinergic toxidrome from agents such as organophosphates or nerve gases like sarin. None of these symptoms are seen in this patient.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA tricyclic antidepressant overdose can cause QRS widening on ECG as well as an anticholinergic toxidrome (dry, flushed skin, constipation, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, and altered mental status).",

However, CF is also typically associated with pancreatic insufficiency leading to malabsorption, failure to thrive, and abnormal bowel movements. This patient has normal weight percentiles and normal bowel habits, making CF less likely. \n\nIn contrast, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic cough with mucus production, and bronchiectasis, because of impaired mucociliary clearance.

Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial. The authors found that patients who received intranasal naloxone needed a second dose of naloxone more frequently compared to patients who received intramuscular naloxone. The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration). This patient is oxygenating well, protecting his airway, and does not have profound bradypnea.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOpioid overdose presents with somnolence, pinpoint pupils, decreased bowel sounds, and bradypnea; stable patients who are adequately breathing and protecting their airway require only observation until clinically sober.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with pain upon defecation, constipation, and a fissure lateral to the midline which is suggestive of an anal fissure. Anal fissures lateral to the midline are associated with inflammatory and infectious etiologies; thus, further workup (testing for HIV, fecal occult blood testing, and sexually transmitted disease testing) is needed rather than merely symptomatic treatment.\n\nAnal fissures present with exquisite pain upon defecation which may lead to fecal retention and constipation. Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient\u2019s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures. They note that while both operative and non-operative interventions may be indicated in the management of an anal fissure after alternative diagnoses have been ruled out, advances in medical management may spare patients sphincter-dividing surgery. They recommend considering all modalities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis followed by an MRI may be the most appropriate testing if a perirectal abscess is suspected. These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation. It would be inappropriate to only treat this patient symptomatically with a lateral anal fissure as this is a sign of a more serious diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnal fissures that are lateral to the midline require workup for sexually transmitted infections, cancer, and autoimmune disease.",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

            "Step 1: Key Case Details\n\u2022 The patient is a 55\u2010year\u2010old man who initially presented with an inferior wall myocardial infarction (ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF) and was managed appropriately.\n\u2022 On day 2 after the MI treatment, the patient develops abdominal pain.\n\u2022 His lab tests show an elevated serum lipase (272 U/L) and slightly elevated creatinine (1.6 mg/dL).\n\u2022 The physical exam is noted to have an abnormality (Figure A), which in this context is most likely a skin finding (often seen with embolic phenomena).\n\nStep 2: Differential Diagnosis Considerations\nA. Cholesterol embolism \u2013 This syndrome can occur after catheterization procedures (commonly in older patients with atherosclerotic disease) when manipulation of vessels dislodges cholesterol crystals. It can cause systemic findings including gastrointestinal (abdominal pain), renal impairment (elevated creatinine), and characteristic skin manifestations such as livedo reticularis or blue/purple discoloration of the toes.\nB. Heart failure and reinfarction \u2013 Reinfarction or heart failure typically presents with chest pain, dyspnea, or signs of fluid overload rather than isolated abdominal pain and the specific skin findings.\nC. Medication side effect \u2013 While medications can have adverse effects, the combination of abdominal pain, elevated lipase, renal impairment, and a distinct skin finding makes a simple medication side effect less likely.\nD. Pancreatitis \u2013 Elevated lipase supports pancreatitis; however, the modestly raised lipase level and the presence of additional systemic and skin findings make primary pancreatitis less likely.\nE. Renal failure \u2013 Although there is a mild rise in creatinine, renal failure alone is unlikely to cause abdominal pain and the skin findings observed.\n\nStep 3: Reasoning Toward the Final Answer\nThe patient\u2019s presentation following cardiovascular intervention, combined with the constellation of abdominal pain, elevated pancreatic enzyme (lipase), mild renal impairment, and particularly the described skin exam finding in Figure A, is most consistent with a cholesterol embolism phenomenon. Cholesterol embolization syndrome arises from dislodged atherosclerotic plaques that travel to occlude small vessels, resulting in systemic findings (GI symptoms, renal dysfunction, and characteristic skin changes).\n\nFinal Answer: A. Cholesterol embolism",
            "Step 1: Review the patient\u2019s clinical course.\n\u2022\u2003The 55\u2010year\u2010old man initially presented with an inferior myocardial infarction (ST elevations in II, III, and aVF) and was treated appropriately. On hospital day 2 he develops abdominal pain.\n\u2022\u2003He now has a mildly elevated serum lipase (272 U/L) and an increased creatinine (1.6 mg/dL), suggesting new-onset renal impairment.\n\u2022\u2003A physical exam finding is provided in Figure A (which, although not shown here, is described in the vignette as \u201cnotable\u201d and serves as an important clue).\n\nStep 2: Compare the answer choices.\nA. Cholesterol embolism\n\u2003\u2013 This syndrome may occur after invasive vascular procedures (e.g., catheterization during MI treatment) in older patients with atherosclerotic disease.\n\u2003\u2013 It can present days later with multi\u2010organ involvement: abdominal pain (from GI ischemia), renal failure (elevated creatinine), and characteristic cutaneous findings (livedo reticularis, purple discoloration, or \u201cblue toe syndrome\u201d), which is most likely what is seen in Figure A.\n\u2003\u2013 Mild enzyme elevations (like a modest increase in lipase) may be seen if the pancreas is affected.\nB. Heart failure and reinfarction\n\u2003\u2013 These complications would typically manifest with chest pain and pulmonary or systemic signs of heart failure \u2014 abdominal pain is atypical.\nC. Medication side effect\n\u2003\u2013 Although medications post\u2010MI can have side effects, they are less likely to cause the combination of abdominal pain, renal impairment, and the specific exam finding.\nD. Pancreatitis\n\u2003\u2013 A primary episode of pancreatitis would cause epigastric pain and elevated lipase; however, isolated pancreatitis would not explain the concurrent renal dysfunction and the exam finding shown in Figure A.\nE. Renal failure\n\u2003\u2013 While his creatinine is elevated, renal failure in isolation typically does not cause abdominal pain or the described skin findings.\n\nStep 3: Synthesize the information.\nThe patient\u2019s clinical picture following an invasive cardiac procedure, the abdominal pain with modest lipase elevation, renal impairment, and a noteworthy physical exam finding (likely a skin manifestation such as livedo reticularis or blue discoloration) point toward a cholesterol embolism syndrome (also known as atheroembolic disease). This can happen when manipulation during catheterization dislodges atherosclerotic plaques, sending cholesterol emboli to multiple vascular beds (including the renal, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous circulations).\n\nFinal answer: A. Cholesterol embolism",
            "Step 1: Review the clinical details. The patient is a 55\u2010year\u2010old man with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity who presented with an inferior wall ST elevation myocardial infarction. After appropriate treatment (likely including catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention), on hospital day 2 he develops abdominal pain. His labs reveal an elevated lipase (272 U/L) and a mildly increased creatinine (1.6 mg/dL). The exam also notes a notable skin finding (as shown in Figure A).\n\nStep 2: Consider the options.\n\u2022 Option A (Cholesterol embolism): After catheterization, cholesterol emboli (also known as atheroembolism syndrome) may dislodge, causing microemboli that travel to various peripheral organs. This manifests as skin findings (such as livedo reticularis or blue toe syndrome), gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain due to mesenteric or pancreatic ischemia), and renal dysfunction.\n\u2022 Option B (Heart failure and reinfarction): Although possible after an MI, his current labs (lipase and creatinine) and specific skin findings do not support this.\n\u2022 Option C (Medication side effect): The scenario doesn\u2019t strongly suggest a common side effect from his post\u2010MI medications that would cause these lab and exam findings.\n\u2022 Option D (Pancreatitis): Although an elevated lipase suggests pancreatic involvement, acute pancreatitis generally needs a different clinical context. In this setting, rather than primary pancreatitis, pancreatic ischemia due to embolization is more likely.\n\u2022 Option E (Renal failure): His creatinine is elevated, but this is more likely a part of a systemic process (e.g., embolization) rather than primary renal failure causing his other symptoms.\n\nStep 3: Synthesize the findings and choose the answer.\nGiven the history of recent catheterization, the constellation of abdominal pain, elevated lipase, renal dysfunction, and characteristic skin findings, the most likely diagnosis is cholesterol embolism syndrome.\n\nFinal answer: A.

West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data. Therefore, the pathophysiology of West syndrome is more likely CRH-excess mediated rather than due to a deficiency of vitamin B6.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWest syndrome, which may be caused by CRH excess, presents with hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression, and infantile spasms.",

He is admitted to the medical intensive care unit for continuous electroencephalogram monitoring while on a midazolam infusion for seizure suppression and supportive care for his burn. Overnight, the nurse continued to increase the patient's midazolam infusion rate, but she also noticed that his left toes were cold to the touch with significant edema. His temperature is now 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 10/min and oxygen saturation is 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

The initial inflammation causes vasodilatation and hyperemia, which can progress to edema and local microvascular thrombosis. If not promptly addressed, tissue necrosis and irreversible damage can occur. Circumferential burns can evolve into eschars that constrict blood flow and cause distal compartment syndrome. A delta pressure (diastolic pressure minus local compartment pressure) lower than 30 mmHg is diagnostic. In the case of eschar-induced compartment syndrome, the most appropriate next step is escharotomy to alleviate pressure.\n\nOrmiston and Marappa-Ganeshan review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with compartment syndrome. They discuss how this condition can be caused by many different pathologies including burns. They recommend the emergent release of constrictive structures.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amputation may be necessary if the distal limb is completely necrotic and not salvageable. Timely release of the eschar can allow for reperfusion of the limb and prevent this outcome.\n\nAnswer C: Fasciotomy is the treatment of choice for compartment syndrome not due to a circumferential eschar, but in this case the least invasive surgical intervention should be performed first without releasing all the compartments of the lower leg.

            "Step 1: Gather the key details. The patient has a circumferential thermal burn to his left leg that is creating a constrictive eschar. The exam is concerning for compromised circulation (cold toes, significant edema, absent pulses) with a delta pressure of 25 mmHg, indicating a likely compromised perfusion due to the burn eschar.\n\nStep 2: Understand the implications. In circumferential burns, a tough eschar can act like a tourniquet, restricting blood flow to the extremity. A delta pressure (diastolic pressure minus compartment pressure) of less than 30 mmHg is worrisome and is an indication for intervention. The first-line management in this scenario is an escharotomy. Escharotomy is performed to release the burn eschar, which is the constricting band on the skin, thereby relieving the compartmental pressure and restoring circulation.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the other options.\n\u2022 Option A (Amputation) is overly aggressive and not indicated at this stage.\n\u2022 Option C (Fasciotomy) is typically reserved for cases of compartment syndrome due to internal tissue swelling that persists even after relieving the external constriction; it is not first-line management in a burn-induced compartment syndrome.\n\u2022 Option D (Intravenous fluid infusion based on the Parkland formula) is critical in treating burn patients; however, it does not address the circulatory compromise due to the constricting eschar.\n\u2022 Option E (Transfer to burn center) may eventually be necessary for further care but does not immediately address the limb-threatening complication.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct management. The best next step is to perform an escharotomy to relieve the constriction and restore blood flow.\n\nFinal answer: B. Escharotomy",
            "Step 1: Identify Key Details\n\u2022 The patient sustained a circumferential thermal burn around his left leg.\n\u2022 Overnight, he developed signs of compromised blood flow in his left leg: his toes are cold, significant edema is present, and both dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are absent.\n\u2022 A delta pressure of 25 mmHg was measured. (In the context of burns, a delta pressure\u2014defined as diastolic blood pressure minus the compartment pressure\u2014less than 30 mmHg is indicative of compartment syndrome.)\n\nStep 2: Determine the Likely Complication\n\u2022 A circumferential burn can form a tight, non-elastic eschar that restricts tissue expansion.\n\u2022 The pressure from the eschar can lead to compartment syndrome, in which the increased pressure impairs blood flow to the tissues.\n\u2022 The combination of clinical signs (cold, edematous toes and absent pulses) and a low delta pressure confirms this.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Management Options\nA. Amputation \u2013 This is an extreme measure not indicated at this stage.\nB. Escharotomy \u2013 In burn-induced compartment syndrome, this is the immediate management step; it involves incising the eschar to relieve the constrictive pressure and restore blood flow.\nC. Fasciotomy \u2013 Generally used for compartment syndrome from other causes; in burn-related cases, escharotomy is usually sufficient.\nD.

The pathophysiology of HA is vascular ectasia from exposure to OCPs and androgens.\n\nA hepatic adenoma typically occurs secondary to exposure to OCPs and androgens (anabolic steroids) causing a generalized vascular ectasia. Both of these drugs should be discontinued in patients with hepatic adenoma. Symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Sudden worsening of pain with unstable vitals suggests a ruptured hepatic adenoma. Patients should be managed with fluids and an ultrasound should be performed to support the diagnosis. Additional imaging tests include an abdominal contrast-enhanced CT to better characterize the pathologic anatomy in this disease. The definitive treatment in this disease is surgery in order to remove the hepatic adenoma. In cases of a ruptured hepatic adenomas, patients require transfusion and operative management.\n\nBioulac-Sage et al. present the current data that are available for classifying hepatic adenomas. They discuss how many of these lesions involve alterations of the HNF1A gene, the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and the CTNNB1 gene. They recommend performing molecular analysis in order to better understand which lesions are likely to undergo malignant transformation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ectopic implantation of a blastocyst (ectopic pregnancy) that has ruptured could present similarly to what this patient is experiencing.

This would present with epigastric pain after a fatty meal or alcohol consumption. Though this patient does drink more than recommended and should be counseled to reduce her consumption, the pain began after exercising at the gym and there are no other symptoms of pancreatitis.\n\nAnswer C: Obstruction of blood flow through the hepatic vein causes Budd-Chiari syndrome, which presents with a non-specific triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly in the setting of a hypercoagulable state (factor V Leiden, polycythemia vera, OCP use, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria).

Given that he has no other associated injuries, trephination is the only management indicated.\n\nA subungual hematoma occurs after trauma to the finger leading to a collection of blood under the fingernail. Depending on the mechanism, this can be associated with a distal phalanx fracture. Evaluation for a fracture should include a thorough history, exam, and radiography. If there are no other signs of injury including nailbed dislocation or an open fracture, then management requires only trephination (putting a hole in the nail to allow blood to drain) as this alleviates pressure on the nailbed matrix thus preventing possible irreversible damage.\n\nRsoer et al. compare nail bed repair to nail trephination for subungual hematomas in children.

            "Step 1: Review the clinical context. This 27\u2010year\u2010old woman was treated for an abnormal vaginal discharge related to high\u2010risk sexual behavior. As part of safe sex counseling, she would now likely be using condoms. Three days after receiving antibiotics, she reports that a rash appears on her skin every time she has sexual intercourse.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the trigger. The key clue is that the rash is temporally associated with intercourse. Although she recently received antibiotics (which might make one consider a fixed drug eruption), a fixed drug eruption would recur after re\u2010exposure to the drug\u2014not with sexual activity. Instead, the recurrent appearance of the rash in association with intercourse suggests that an allergen encountered during sex is provoking the reaction.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate alternatives. \n\u2022 A drug reaction (eg, a fixed drug eruption) is less likely because she is not taking the antibiotic repeatedly during intercourse.\n\u2022 Infection, IV drug use, and photosensitivity are not consistent with a recurrent, intercourse-related rash.\n\u2022 The remaining option, antigen exposure, is most consistent with an IgE-mediated allergic reaction (eg, to latex in condoms or to one of the components of a condom lubricant).\n\nStep 4: Final answer.

Antigen exposure \u2013 This choice implies an allergic reaction triggered by an antigen encountered during intercourse (for example, latex from condoms or another substance applied during sexual activity). The recurrent nature of the rash with every sexual encounter supports a contact allergic reaction.\nB.

IV drug use \u2013 Although she has a history of IV drug use, there is no temporal or situational connection between this history and the recurrent rash related to intercourse.\nE. Photosensitivity \u2013 This reaction is typically due to exposure to sunlight and does not relate to sexual activity.\n\nStep 3: Final Answer\nThe most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms is an allergic reaction to an antigen encountered during sexual intercourse (e.g., latex exposure). \n\nFinal answer: A.

If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects. Prophylactic treatment should be initiated immediately (ideally within 1-2 hours) and continued for 4 weeks at which time the healthcare worker\u2019s serology should be repeated.\n\nParikh et al. studied technologies for monitoring HIV infection. They discuss how high throughput methods are required in order to surveil for infection on a population level. They recommend using next-generation sequencing methods to improve surveillance methods.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Immediately initiating triple antiretroviral therapy is appropriate after drawing the medical student\u2019s HIV serology. The patient\u2019s serology at the time of exposure must be established to compare to future testing. Despite her previous negative serology and low-risk lifestyle, it would still be best to repeat the testing at the same time prophylactic treatment is initiated.\n\nAnswer B: Perform genotype testing on source patient and initiate antiretroviral therapy tailored to results is incorrect because this option would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Empiric treatment with a triple antiretroviral drug combination is appropriate for all patients with high-risk exposure.\n\nAnswer C: Waiting to hear that the medical student\u2019s HIV serology is negative would delay the initiation of prophylaxis. Triple antiretroviral drug treatment should be initiated without waiting for the results. Empiric treatment of all patients with high-risk exposure is recommended in all cases.\n\nAnswer D: Waiting for the results of the medical student\u2019s serology would delay treatment for her exposure. If her serology is already positive, she will need to be treated past the 4-week period of prophylaxis. Even though she does not engage in high-risk behaviors, a positive serology would demonstrate that she was already infected with HIV.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAfter a needlestick injury from a HIV-positive source patient, a healthcare worker\u2019s HIV serology should be drawn and they should be immediately initiated on triple antiretroviral drug therapy.",

Emergency laparoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy, due to implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube, can be life-threatening if it ruptures leading to intra-abdominal hemorrhage and shock. Initial laboratory studies should include a complete blood count and a pregnancy test. A patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability should be ascertained immediately as it determines the most appropriate next step in management. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable (hypotensive and tachycardic), a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam should be immediately performed to evaluate for intraperitoneal bleeding, and ob/gyn should be immediately consulted for emergent surgical intervention (e.g., salpingectomy or salpingotomy).

Duodenal ulcers are often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a urease-producing organism.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions and defects in the mucosal lining of the small intestines that allow for damage to the underlying tissues. Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori. If the patient tests positive for H. pylori infection, treatment involves triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor. Patients who fail to improve should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\n\nCiociola et al. studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers.

Mucosal defect in the stomach \u2013 A gastric ulcer can cause pain but typically worsens with food and is less likely given the patient\u2019s pain relief with smaller, more frequent meals.\nC. Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine \u2013 This finding is characteristic of Crohn disease, which usually presents with diarrhea and weight loss, not the described pattern.\nD. PAS-positive material in the small intestine \u2013 This finding is seen in Whipple disease, which presents with malabsorption, weight loss, and systemic symptoms.\nE. Urease-producing organism in the small intestine \u2013 H. pylori is a gram-negative, curved rod that is urease positive. H. pylori infection is the most common cause of duodenal ulcers and is associated with the clinical scenario described.\n\nStep 3: Final Answer\nThe best answer is: E. Urease-producing organism in the small intestine."

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with diffuse muscle/joint pain, Raynaud phenomenon, and dysphagia suggesting a diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease. Anti-ribonucleoprotein (U1) antibodies are found in this disease.\n\nMixed connective tissue disease can present with a vast array of symptoms. The most common symptoms are Raynaud phenomenon (vascular hyper-reactivity that presents with burning/pain in the hands where the hands change color from white to blue to red, seen in Figure A), arthralgias, myalgias, dysphagia, and edema of the hands. Anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein antibodies are commonly found in mixed connective tissue disease and are a specific marker. In this disease, there is typically an absence of renal involvement. Treatment involves steroids as well as calcium channel blockers for symptomatic control of Raynaud phenomenon.\n\nBatu et al. review the evidence regarding patients with mixed connective tissue disease. They found that many patients have overlapping symptoms with systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. They recommend studying patients with these mixed characteristics in order to better understand which treatment modalities are effective.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing the blanching of the distal fingers (red box). This finding demonstrates the Raynaud phenomenon during the early phase where the vessels have spasmed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anti-dsDNA is a specific marker in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE presents with SOAP BRAIN MD - Serositis, Oral ulcers, Arthritis, Photosensitivity, Blood disorders (hemolytic anemia, etc.), Renal involvement, ANA, Immune phenomena (anti-dsDNA, Smith), Neurological symptoms, Malar rash, and Discoid rash. Four of these criteria must be met to suspect a diagnosis of SLE. Treatment is with hydroxychloroquine.\n\nAnswer B: Anti-IgG Fc region is representative of rheumatoid factor which is found in rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis can present with fever, weight loss, and joint pain that worsens in the morning and improves with activity. It is common for the joints of the hands to become deformed due to the disease process. Treatment is with methotrexate.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are likely positive in this patient; however, they are not more likely to aid in making the diagnosis than anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies are. ANA are non-specific and can be found in many rheumatological conditions such as MCTD, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAnswer E: Anti-Ro antibodies are found in Sjogren syndrome which presents with dry eyes, dry mouth, dental caries, and dyspareunia. A salivary gland biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes artificial tears, vitamin D supplementation, and pilocarpine or cevimeline.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMixed connective tissue disease is associated with anti-ribonuleoprotein antibodies and presents with Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgia/arthritis, swollen hands, sclerodactyly, and myositis.",

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with both absence seizures (periods of inattentiveness in school) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (abnormal, involuntary spasms of her upper extremity). The most appropriate treatment for these conditions is valproic acid.\n\nAbsence seizures classically present with cessation of motor activity and speech with a blank facial expression and occasionally automatisms such as flickering of the eyelids. They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. In post-pubertal female patients, it is important to counsel them on the potential teratogenic effects of this medication and also to consider alternative treatments in patients who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices.\n\nKessler and McGinnis discuss the treatment of childhood absence seizures. They discuss how the treatment of choice is ethosuximide due to its favorable side effect profile. They recommend using valproic acid if there are concurrent seizure conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Carbamazepine would be the appropriate therapy for a partial seizure (tonic or clonic movements in addition to an absence of a post-ictal period) or for trigeminal neuralgia (sudden pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve). It would not address both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n\nAnswer B: Cognitive behavioral therapy is a useful treatment that helps a patient develop coping strategies and change unhelpful patterns of thought. It could be useful if this girl was having trouble focusing in school for another reason (such as obsessive-compulsive disorder); however, it is not useful in managing seizures.\n\nAnswer C: Ethosuximide is the most appropriate initial therapy for absence seizures. In this patient, she is suffering from both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which could not be treated by ethosuximide alone, in contrast to valproic acid which could treat both conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Lamotrigine is an anti-epileptic that can also be used as a mood stabilizer. It carries the potentially severe side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is not a first-line treatment for absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Stevens-Johnson syndrome will present with painful desquamation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAbsence seizures present with periods of inattentiveness and subtle automatisms and are most appropriately treated with ethosuximide or with valproic acid if there is concurrent juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.",

Worsening of symptoms after initiation of these therapies is concerning for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is managed by continuing current combined antiretroviral medications, antibiotics for opportunistic infections and symptom management.\n\nIRIS describes a paradoxical worsening of a patient's underlying infection after initiating antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV. IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection. Thus, there is a paradoxical worsening of the infection symptoms. When patients have a paradoxical worsening of their symptoms in the setting of starting their antiretroviral therapy, the therapy should be continued with symptomatic management (acetaminophen for fever).\n\nNelson et al review IRIS. They note it is seen in patients with HIV. They recommend antiretroviral therapy and antibiotics for bacterial infections.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Determining drug sensitivities against the patient\u2019s pulmonary infection would be of low diagnostic utility since IRIS best explains his current clinical presentation.\n\nAnswer C: Discontinuing antimicrobial treatment would not be appropriate since the patient has findings concerning for tuberculosis (upper lobe lung infiltrate), and lack of treatment can lead to progression of his infection.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a D-dimer level is only indicated in low-risk patients for pulmonary embolism by Wells criteria.\n\nAnswer E: Starting high-dose glucocorticoid treatment and discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not be appropriate since discontinuing his antiretroviral therapy would not control his HIV infection, which would place him at greater risk of acquiring opportunistic infections.

This 57\u2010year-old woman has a 6\u2010month history of weakness with worsening symptoms, weight gain, depression, and sparse, fine hair. These findings point toward a metabolic cause of myopathy. Additionally, she has a rash on her face and arms, a finding that can sometimes be associated with hypothyroidism (for example, dry skin and myxedema).\n\nStep 2: Consider the laboratory and biopsy findings. Although the serum electrolytes are largely unremarkable, the slightly low potassium is not sufficient to explain her chronic weakness. The muscle biopsy (Figure A) would likely show changes such as type II fiber atrophy, which is characteristic of hypothyroid myopathy.\n\nStep 3: Review and eliminate answer choices:\n\u2022 Dermatomyositis (Option A) typically presents with proximal muscle weakness and characteristic rashes (e.g., heliotrope rash, Gottron papules), yet it does not account for weight gain, depression, and the thyroid-related signs like sparse hair.\n\u2022 Hypokalemia (Option B) can cause weakness, but the patient\u2019s borderline low potassium level and chronic course do not support periodic paralysis.\n\u2022 Hypothyroidism (Option C) perfectly aligns with her symptoms of weight gain, depression, sparse hair, and myopathy findings on biopsy.\n\u2022 Inclusion body myositis (Option D) occurs more often in older men and has a different pattern of weakness (often asymmetric with involvement of the finger flexors and quadriceps).\n\u2022 Polymyositis (Option E) usually presents with proximal muscle weakness but lacks the characteristic dermatologic findings and systemic symptoms seen in this patient.\n\nStep 4: Final Answer\nThe constellation of chronic weakness, weight gain, depression, sparse hair, and the muscle biopsy findings is most consistent with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. \n\nFinal answer: C.

Dermatomyositis \u2013 While dermatomyositis is characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness and a rash (often a heliotrope rash on the eyelids and Gottron papules on the extensor surfaces), the associated systemic features such as weight gain, depression, and sparse fine hair are less typical. Additionally, dermatomyositis usually shows perimysial inflammation and complement deposition on biopsy.\nB. Hypokalemia \u2013 Though hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness, the weakness here has been chronic and progressive over months rather than episodic, and the degree of hypokalemia (3.3 mEq/L) is only mildly low and unlikely to solely account for her presentation.\nC. Hypothyroidism \u2013 Hypothyroidism can cause a myopathy that leads to proximal muscle weakness, as well as fatigue, weight gain, depression, and hair changes (sparse, fine hair). The presence of a rash (often dry, coarse skin changes) can also be seen in hypothyroidism. A muscle biopsy in hypothyroid myopathy may show nonspecific fiber atrophy and increased glycogen accumulation.\nD. Inclusion body myositis \u2013 Typically seen in older adults, it generally has an insidious onset with asymmetric involvement (especially of the finger flexors and quadriceps) and lacks a distinctive rash.\nE.

The patient is a 57\u2010year\u2010old woman with:\n\u2022 A 6\u2010month history of worsening weakness\n\u2022 Fatigue, weight gain, and depression\n\u2022 Sparse, fine hair\n\u2022 A rash on her face and arms\nLaboratory values reveal a mildly low potassium. While hypokalemia can contribute to muscle weakness, a level of 3.3 mEq/L is only slightly low and does not fully account for her chronic systemic symptoms.\n\nStep 2: Consider the choices.\n\u2022 Dermatomyositis typically presents with proximal muscle weakness plus a heliotrope rash (a violaceous discoloration around the eyes) and Gottron papules over the extensor surfaces, which differ from this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\u2022 Inclusion body myositis and polymyositis are inflammatory myopathies that cause progressive muscle weakness, but they are not characterized by weight gain, depression, and sparse, fine hair.\n\u2022 Hypothyroidism, however, commonly causes weight gain, depression, coarse hair thinning (or sparse fine hair), and myopathy with proximal muscle weakness. The rash on her face and arms can represent thyroid-related skin changes (myxedema) in the setting of hypothyroidism.\n\nStep 3: Narrowing down the answer.\nThe patient\u2019s constellation of systemic symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, depression, changes in hair texture, and significant muscle weakness, is most consistent with hypothyroidism. Although she has a mild low potassium, this finding is not sufficient to explain the full clinical picture. Inflammatory myopathies (dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis) do not account for the metabolic changes and hair findings.\n\nFinal Answer: C. Hypothyroidism"

Additionally, dermatomyositis usually shows perimysial inflammation and complement deposition on biopsy.\nB. Hypokalemia \u2013 Though hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness, the weakness here has been chronic and progressive over months rather than episodic, and the degree of hypokalemia (3.3 mEq/L) is only mildly low and unlikely to solely account for her presentation.\nC. Hypothyroidism \u2013 Hypothyroidism can cause a myopathy that leads to proximal muscle weakness, as well as fatigue, weight gain, depression, and hair changes (sparse, fine hair). The presence of a rash (often dry, coarse skin changes) can also be seen in hypothyroidism. A muscle biopsy in hypothyroid myopathy may show nonspecific fiber atrophy and increased glycogen accumulation.\nD.

It is more common in young patients who are active (e.g. marathon runners). The classic conventional radiographic finding in cecal volvulus is the coffee bean sign, in which closed loops of intestine distend with gas, making visible the medial and lateral walls of dilated bowel. Diagnosis of cecal volvulus can be confirmed with a CT scan. Management involves analgesia, intravenous fluids, and surgical detorsion.\n\nHasbahceci et al. review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of cecal volvulus. The authors find that abdominal radiography has a low sensitivity for cecal volvulus. The authors recommend surgical management of cecal volvulus with resection with right hemicolectomy and primary ileocolic anastomosis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a radiograph demonstrating the \"coffee bean\" sign which is suggestive of a cecal volvulus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Ileus presents after surgery or manipulation of the intestines with decreased peristalsis of the intestine leading to a failure to pass gas or have bowel movements. Treatment involves treating any electrolyte abnormalities, encouraging ambulation, and avoiding medications that decrease peristalsis (such as opioids).\n\nAnswer C: Ogilvie syndrome occurs when the colon wall is not appropriately undergoing peristalsis leading to a dilated colon with abdominal distension. It is more common in the elderly and critically ill patients. Treatment involves the placement of a rectal tube to decompress the intestines and treatment of any underlying medical conditions.\n\nAnswer D: Sigmoid volvulus is more common in elderly and critically ill patients and presents with constipation, an absence of bowel movements, and a distended, tympanitic abdomen. Although the coffee bean sign may also be seen in patients with sigmoid volvulus, patients tend to be older. In addition, plain radiography typically demonstrates multiple air-fluid levels in a sigmoid volvulus versus usually only a single air-fluid level in a cecal volvulus. Treatment involves flexible sigmoidoscopy and surgery.\n\nAnswer E: Small bowel obstruction presents with a distended and tympanitic abdomen with nausea, vomiting, and an absence of flatus or bowel movements. Radiography may demonstrate distended bowel and air-fluid levels, and the most accurate test is a CT scan of the abdomen. It occurs secondary to adhesions entrapping the bowel.

The increased PTH results in renal phosphate wasting, increased production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and increased renal calcium reabsorption.

The alkaline phosphatase is slightly high, which may reflect bone turnover. This combination of hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia is most consistent with a process that involves increased parathyroid hormone (PTH).\n\nStep 2: Consider her symptoms. The patient has abdominal pain, trouble focusing, and weight loss. These symptoms can be associated with hypercalcemia. The classic saying \u201cbones, stones, groans, and psychiatric overtones\u201d is a mnemonic for primary hyperparathyroidism, where high levels of PTH cause bone demineralization (bones), kidney stones (stones), gastrointestinal upset (groans), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (psychiatric overtones).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option.\n\nA. Antacid overuse \u2013 Although antacids containing calcium can lead to milk-alkali syndrome, that condition typically presents with metabolic alkalosis and renal failure due to calcium over-ingestion. Her labs (normal bicarbonate and creatinine) do not support this.\n\nB. Increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D \u2013 This is seen in conditions like sarcoidosis, where macrophages convert vitamin D to its active form, causing hypercalcemia.

Increased parathyroid hormone",
            "Step 1: Review the laboratory findings. This patient has hypercalcemia (Ca\u00b2\u207a = 12.5 mg/dL) and low phosphorus (2.0 mg/dL), along with a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase (150 U/L). In primary hyperparathyroidism, excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases serum calcium by promoting bone resorption, increased renal calcium reabsorption, and increased activation of vitamin D to boost intestinal calcium absorption. Simultaneously, PTH causes renal excretion of phosphate, leading to hypophosphatemia.\n\nStep 2: Consider the patient\u2019s clinical presentation. The patient complains of abdominal pain, trouble focusing, and weight loss\u2014symptoms that can be seen when hypercalcemia affects multiple organ systems (often remembered by the mnemonic \u201cbones, stones, groans, and psychiatric overtones\u201d). While the cough is noted, it is unclear if it is related to her primary issue and it is only present for a short duration.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the options. \n\u2022 Option A (Antacid overuse) could cause milk-alkali syndrome; however, that condition typically presents with metabolic alkalosis and does not usually produce the degree of weight loss and neuropsychiatric symptoms seen here.\n\u2022 Option B (Increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) is commonly seen in granulomatous disorders like sarcoidosis, which are more common in African Americans. However, such disorders would typically raise both calcium and phosphate levels due to increased intestinal absorption, which does not match the low phosphorus here.\n\u2022 Option C (Increased parathyroid hormone) is consistent with the laboratory findings (hypercalcemia with hypophosphatemia) and the patient\u2019s symptoms.\n\u2022 Option D (Malignancy) can cause hypercalcemia through paraneoplastic production of PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), but this patient is a non-smoker and the overall picture fits primary hyperparathyroidism better.\n\u2022 Option E (Viral illness) does not explain the constellation of electrolyte abnormalities.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion. The clinical scenario most consistently points to primary hyperparathyroidism due to increased parathyroid hormone secretion.\n\nFinal answer: C. Increased parathyroid hormone",
            "Step 1: Identify the abnormal lab findings and symptoms.\n\u2022 The serum calcium is elevated (12.5 mg/dL) along with low phosphorus (2.0 mg/dL) and a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase (150 U/L).\n\u2022 The patient also has nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, difficulty focusing, weight loss, and a recent cough.\n\nStep 2: Consider the possible explanations.\nA. Antacid overuse (e.g., milk-alkali syndrome) typically leads to hypercalcemia but is usually accompanied by metabolic alkalosis and renal dysfunction. This patient\u2019s creatinine is normal, and there are no signs of alkalosis.\nB. Increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is most commonly seen in granulomatous diseases (like sarcoidosis) which elevate vitamin D; however, the clinical picture does not support a granulomatous process here.\nC. Increased parathyroid hormone indicates primary hyperparathyroidism. In this condition, excessive PTH causes increased bone resorption (which may raise alkaline phosphatase), hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. The clinical symptoms (\u201cgroans\u201d including abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric difficulties) fit this condition.\nD. Malignancy (especially via PTH-related peptide) can mimic primary hyperparathyroidism. However, she is a non-smoker and there is less evidence of a primary malignant process.\nE. A viral illness would not explain the markedly abnormal calcium and phosphate levels.\n\nStep 3: Arriving at the decision.\nThe lab findings of high calcium and low phosphate, combined with symptoms like abdominal pain and cognitive difficulties, are most consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism due to increased parathyroid hormone secretion.\n\nFinal Answer: C.

She denies dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea. The patient had a myocardial infarction 6 months ago, and she now has multiple drug-eluting stents. Her ECG upon discharge from that hospitalization was normal. The patient has been taking all of her medications as instructed. Her medical history is otherwise significant for rheumatoid arthritis and migraines. Her home medications include methotrexate, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, and aspirin. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 118/75 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 12/min. On physical exam, she has an irregular heartbeat with normal cardiac sounds. Her abdomen is non-distended and she has mild lower extremity edema. Her current ECG can be seen in Figure A.

        "reason": "This patient who presents with lightheadedness and is found to have progressive prolongation of the PR interval on ECG most likely has Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block. Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular node dysfunction.\n\nSecond degree heart block can be divided into Mobitz type 1 and Mobitz type 2 patterns. The Mobitz type 1 pattern is usually a result of dysfunction at the atrioventricular (AV) node, whereas the Mobitz type 2 pattern is usually caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. In Mobitz type 1 2nd-degree heart block, the PR interval becomes progressively longer with each beat before the dropped QRS complex. In Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block, the PR intervals are consistent in length and the dropped QRS complexes occur at regular intervals. The easiest way to determine whether the PR interval is getting longer is to compare the PR interval just before the dropped beat to the PR interval immediately following the dropped beat. Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block. They discuss how a type 1 2nd-degree heart block is caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. They recommend symptomatic treatment of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG that demonstrates the progressive prolongation of the PR interval (blue lines) until a beat is dropped. This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia. Sinoatrial node dysfunction can be treated with pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped QRS complex and is usually caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node.",

This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole.

They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber.

        "reason": "This patient is presenting with recurrent episodes of significant swelling of his lips and tongue with minor trauma, which are concerning for hereditary angioedema. Fresh frozen plasma is the most effective therapy for hereditary angioedema of the options listed.\n\nAngioedema is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with severe edema of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. It can be caused by antigens, medications, and trauma or may occur spontaneously. It often presents with notable edema of the lips and tongue and may threaten the airway. There are 3 subtypes. Hereditary and acquired angioedema occur secondary to a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor. As a result, the most effective therapy is to administer fresh frozen plasma which has C1-esterase inhibitor. On the other hand, drug-induced angioedema (often from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) does not respond well to C1-esterase inhibitor replacement and supportive therapy; discontinuing the offending agent is the mainstay of therapy. Other effective but costly treatments that can be used in hereditary angioedema include: icatibant, ecallantide, and C1 inhibitor.\n\nPaige and Anderson note the management of hereditary angioedema. They review the different treatments and discuss C1-esterase inhibitor replacement. They recommend this treatment for acute episodes.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Dexamethasone and other steroids can be given in acute allergic reactions and may reduce the recurrence of symptoms but are unlikely to be effective in angioedema, nor are they the most effective therapy. Steroids can take up to 4 hours to begin having any effect.\n\nAnswer B: Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that could be given for anaphylaxis or urticaria and works immediately; however, it is not the mainstay of therapy for angioedema nor is it the most effective therapy. It is the mainstay of therapy for urticaria. It can also be given in anaphylaxis.\n\nAnswer C: Epinephrine is the treatment of choice for anaphylaxis which presents with urticaria, upper airway swelling, hypotension, nausea/vomiting, and wheezing. It is often given in angioedema but has limited efficacy when compared to fresh frozen plasma.\n\nAnswer E: Tranexamic acid is effective in treating angioedema and current evidence supports its use; however, the mainstay of therapy is still fresh frozen plasma. Tranexamic acid is also used in hemorrhagic shock to stop fibrinolysis and reduce bleeding.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA possible treatment in hereditary or acquired angioedema is the administration of fresh frozen plasma to replace C1-esterase inhibitor.",

Importantly, he has experienced similar episodes in the past. He presents with difficulty breathing but has normal vital signs and no skin findings such as hives, which would suggest an IgE-mediated allergic reaction.\n\nStep 2: Recognize the likely diagnosis. The recurrent episodes of swelling, particularly triggered by minor trauma, are most consistent with hereditary angioedema.

The most appropriate initial therapy is light therapy, behavioral therapy, and sleep hygiene practices in addition to decreasing exposure to light at night.\n\nDelayed sleep phase syndrome typically presents with individuals who naturally fall asleep very late and wake up very late. This becomes problematic when they attend school or have a job that requires them to wake up early. The most appropriate initial therapy for delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene practices, and bright light therapy. Bright light therapy involves consistent timed exposure to a light box to simulate natural outdoor light, with the hope of resetting the circadian rhythm and moving the sleep phase earlier. If these measures fail, or if a different diagnosis is suspected, a referral for polysomnography may be indicated.\n\nSletten et al. studied whether melatonin was effective in the treatment of delayed sleep phase syndrome. They found that using this medication as an adjunct to sleep hygiene was effective in improving symptoms. They recommend using multimodal therapy for this disease.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ethosuximide is the treatment of choice for absence seizures. Though this patient does have episodes of blank staring, this likely does not represent a seizure as he is arousable to return to work by his boss. Patients with absence seizures typically present in childhood and are unable to be aroused during seizure episodes.\n\nAnswer B: Polysomnography or a sleep study would be indicated after sleep hygiene practices have failed. Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if there was a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or an unknown cause of this patient's fatigue. Patients with sleep apnea typically snore and this disease is associated with obesity and increasing age.\n\nAnswer D: Modafinil is a treatment for narcolepsy. Though this patient does have sudden episodes of falling asleep while at work, this is more likely to be related to his sleep schedule. Patients with narcolepsy generally do not feel tired immediately before their episodes of sleep.\n\nAnswer E: Zolpidem is a muscle relaxant and hypnotic with the mechanism of action of a benzodiazepine. Though a drug like zolpidem could be used to help this patient fall asleep, the most appropriate first step is to address the patient's sleep hygiene prior to prescribing a potentially addictive drug.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, and sleep hygiene.",

This delay in sleep onset has resulted in insufficient sleep and daytime sleepiness.\n\u2022 His symptoms began when he started working, likely because his fixed work schedule clashes with his natural sleep timing.\n\nStep 2: Narrow down the differential diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and can include sudden sleep episodes (\u201csleep attacks\u201d), cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or hypnagogic hallucinations. However, the hallmark of narcolepsy is not a difficulty falling asleep at night.\n\u2022 Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) is a circadian rhythm disorder where the patient\u2019s internal sleep schedule is delayed relative to the conventional sleep-wake schedule. Patients often have difficulty falling asleep until very late and then have trouble waking up in time for obligations, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness.\n\nIn this case, the patient\u2019s difficulty falling asleep until very late (2 hours before his alarm) suggests DSPS rather than narcolepsy.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the treatment options.\n\nA. Bright light therapy and decreased light at night  \n\u2003\u2022 DSPS is best managed by shifting the circadian rhythm earlier. Using bright light therapy in the morning and reducing light exposure at night helps reset the circadian clock. This is the first-line therapy in DSPS.\n\nB.

        "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents for worsening symptoms of previously diagnosed acute sinusitis. Initially, the pediatrician prescribed decongestants and sent the patient home. Since then, the patient has developed a nasal discharge with worsening pain. The patient has a medical history of asthma which is well-controlled with albuterol. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/48 mmHg, pulse is 124/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. Inspection of the patient's nose reveals a unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood. The rest of the patient's exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "answer": "Foreign body obstruction",

        "reason": "This patient presents with unilateral bloody/purulent discharge from the nose suggesting a diagnosis of a nasal foreign body.\n\nThe most common cause of unilateral nasal symptoms in a pediatric patient is a nasal foreign body. Nasal foreign bodies tend to be unilateral (though bilateral symptoms are plausible) and present with a purulent and bloody discharge. The treatment of choice is to remove the object which may be done in the emergency department or operating room depending on how deep the object is. Visualization of the object should be attempted when possible in order to allow for safe retrieval.\n\nKrulewitz and Fix review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epistaxis. They discuss how foreign body insertion is a major risk factor for the development of epistaxis. They recommend assessment of airway and breathing in the setting of severe epistaxis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: A bleeding and infected vessel of the Kiesselbach plexus could suggest a complicated case of epistaxis. The persistent, unilateral symptoms in this patient point toward a different diagnosis. A high index of suspicion for foreign bodies should be suspected in children.\n\nAnswer C: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to occur in young male patients and can be associated with infectious mononucleosis. Epistaxis can be a symptom and the mass can be visualized. This disease tends to present in older patients and is far less common than foreign bodies. Treatment is with surgical resection.\n\nAnswer D: Septal perforation can occur secondary to repeat cocaine use but would not present with unilateral nasal discharge in a pediatric patient. It would be highly unlikely in a pediatric patient with no history of drug use. Treatment is with cessation of the offending agent.\n\nAnswer E: Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection would typically present with systemic symptoms as well as bilateral symptoms. Though this diagnosis is possible, it is less likely than a foreign body. Treatment is with systemic antibiotic therapy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA nasal foreign body presents with unilateral bloody/purulent nasal discharge.",

            "Step 1: Evaluate the details of the case. A 7-year-old boy with a history of acute sinusitis, initially managed with decongestants, now presents with worsening symptoms. On exam, there is a unilateral nasal discharge that is purulent and blood-tinged.\n\nStep 2: Consider the differential based on the options:\n\n\u2022 Option A (Bleeding and infected vessel of Kiesselbach plexus) would cause anterior nosebleeds, but typically not a persistent unilateral purulent discharge.\n\n\u2022 Option C (Nasopharyngeal carcinoma) is extremely rare in a child and would be an unlikely cause of this presentation.\n\n\u2022 Option D (Septal perforation) is also uncommon in a child without significant trauma or other risk factors such as cocaine use.\n\n\u2022 Option E (Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection) would usually lead to worsening bilateral symptoms and might produce thick purulent discharge, but it is less likely to cause a distinctly unilateral, blood-tinged discharge.\n\n\u2022 Option B (Foreign body obstruction) is a common occurrence in children and is classically associated with unilateral purulent and sometimes blood-tinged nasal discharge. Although there was an initial diagnosis of sinusitis, the current unilateral findings raise suspicion that a nasal foreign body, which can be missed in the initial evaluation, might now be responsible for the ongoing symptoms.\n\nStep 3: Eliminate the less consistent options, and based on the age of the patient and the unilateral, blood-tinged purulent discharge, conclude that the most likely diagnosis is a foreign body obstruction.\n\nFinal Answer: B.
