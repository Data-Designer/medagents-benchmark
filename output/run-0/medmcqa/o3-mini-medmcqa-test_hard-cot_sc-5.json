Here\u2019s why:\n\n\u2022 In disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), one would typically expect low fibrinogen levels and thrombocytopenia due to platelet consumption, so DIC is less likely.\n\n\u2022 Factor VIII deficiency usually affects only the APTT and not the PT or TT.\n\n\u2022 In liver disease, the synthesis of multiple clotting factors is impaired, leading to prolonged PT, APTT, and often TT even if fibrinogen levels and platelet counts may remain in the normal range during early stages.\n\n\u2022 Vitamin K deficiency primarily prolongs PT and, to some extent, APTT, but TT is less commonly affected.\n\nThus, considering the clinical lab abnormalities, liver disease is the most fitting diagnosis.
