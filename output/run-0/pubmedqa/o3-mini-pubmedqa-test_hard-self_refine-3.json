From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with respect to antral follicle assessment (<or = 6 or>6), basal cycle day 3 follicle stimulated hormone (<or = 10 or>10 IU/L) and maternal age (<or = 35 or>35 years).\nThe clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with baseline antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle>6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and baseline antral follicle<or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher in the group with antral follicle<or = 6 compared to that in the group with antral follicle>or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively).\nAntral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH?",

An early newborn discharge was defined as a discharge between 24 and 47 hours of age. Metabolic screening tests included phenylketonuria (PKU), hypothyroidism, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Early discharge and traditional stay infants were compared to determine the percentage of newborns screened and the timing of the first adequate specimen.\nThe state laboratory received specimens from 3860 infants; 1324 were on early discharge newborns and 2536 infants in the traditional stay group. At least one filter paper test (PKU, hypothyroidism, and CAH) was collected on 99.2% of early discharge infants and 96.0% of traditional stay infants (P<.0001). Early discharge infants had a higher rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate (22.9%) compared with traditional stay infants (14.3%, P<.0001) but had a higher rate of repeat specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate (85.0% early discharge vs 75.3% traditional stay, P=.002).

The scenarios were all possible combinations of five factors: severity of the disease (severe, lethal); time taken to discuss this with (little time, much time); intent to inform the spouse about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); intent to adopt protective behaviours (no intent, intent); and decision to consult an expert in STDs (yes, no), 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2. The importance and interactions of each factor were determined, at the group level, by performing analyses of variance and constructing graphs.\nThe concept of breaching confidentiality to protect a wife from her husband's STD was favoured much more by lay people and psychologists than by physicians (mean ratings 11.76, 9.28 and 2.90, respectively, on a scale of 0-22). The patient's stated intentions to protect his wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability.

The problem asks: \u201cDo French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality\u2026?\u201d The proper answer should state that acceptance is highly context\u2010dependent.

It seems to imply that the answer is conditional, but this does not adequately capture the nuanced findings reported in the study.

First, note that the study presented 48 different scenarios (combinations of factors) to French participants. These factors included severity of the disease, time to discuss the issue, intentions about informing the spouse, the patient\u2019s intent to adopt protective behaviours, and whether an STD expert was consulted.\n\n2. The study measured how acceptable a breach of confidentiality would be. Lay people gave a mean rating of 11.76 out of 22, psychologists a mean of 9.28, whereas physicians rated it very low (2.90). This shows that the idea is far more acceptable to lay people and psychologists than to physicians.\n\n3. Moreover, among lay participants a cluster analysis revealed four distinct groups:\n\u2003\u2022 Some always found breaching confidentiality acceptable,\n\u2003\u2022 Some found it acceptable only depending on many circumstances,\n\u2003\u2022 Some accepted it only if an expert was consulted,\n\u2003\u2022 And a small group never accepted it.\nThis clearly indicates that even within the lay population the acceptability of breaching confidentiality is not absolute but depends on contextual factors.\n\n4. Bringing these findings together, we see that:\n\u2003\u2022 There is no single \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer; instead, acceptance depends on the circumstances.\n\u2003\u2022 Lay people (and to a slightly lesser degree psychologists) show conditional acceptance\u2014depending on multiple factors and the context\u2014whereas physicians are generally opposed.\n\n5. Therefore, the best way to answer the question \u201cDo French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease?\u201d is to say:\n\u2003\u201cAcceptance is conditional.

                "revise_response": "Below is a revised solution with detailed reasoning followed by the final answer.\n\nStep 1. Description of the Study Design\n\u2022 The study presented French participants with 48 different scenarios that were all possible combinations of five factors:\n\u2003\u2013 Severity of the disease (severe, lethal)\n\u2003\u2013 Time available for discussion (little time, much time)\n\u2003\u2013 Patient\u2019s intent to inform the spouse (none, one of these days, immediately)\n\u2003\u2013 Patient\u2019s intent to adopt protective behaviors (no intent, intent)\n\u2003\u2013 Decision to consult an STD expert (yes, no)\n\u2022 There were three groups surveyed: lay people (144 participants), psychologists (10), and physicians (7).\n\nStep 2. Results on Acceptability Ratings\n\u2022 Acceptability of breaching confidentiality was measured on a 0\u201322 scale.\n\u2003\u2013 Lay people gave a mean rating of 11.76\n\u2003\u2013 Psychologists gave a mean rating of 9.28\n\u2003\u2013 Physicians rated acceptance very low (mean = 2.90)\n\u2022 These data indicate that lay people and psychologists find breaching confidentiality more acceptable than physicians do.\n\nStep 3. Role of Contextual Factors\n\u2022 Analyses showed that the patient\u2019s stated intentions\u2014both regarding protecting his wife and informing her of the disease\u2014had the greatest impact on acceptability.\n\u2022 A cluster analysis among lay participants revealed four subgroups:\n\u20031. Those who always found the breach acceptable.\n\u20032. Those whose acceptance depended on many circumstances.\n\u20033. Those who accepted a breach only if an expert was consulted.\n\u20034. Those who never found the breach acceptable.\n\u2022 This reveals that even within the lay population, the view on breaching confidentiality is not uniform but highly conditional.\n\nStep 4. Bringing It All Together\n\u2022 The findings show a clear difference between groups:\n\u2003\u2013 French lay people and psychologists tend to accept breaches of confidentiality\u2014but in a conditional, context\u2010dependent manner. Their acceptance largely depends on factors such as the patient\u2019s proactive intent to protect or inform his wife.\n\u2003\u2013 Physicians, on the other hand, consistently oppose breaching confidentiality, giving it very low acceptability ratings across scenarios.\n\u2022 In summary, whether breaching confidentiality is acceptable depends on who is asked and on the specific circumstances described by the five factors. Lay people (and to a lesser extent psychologists) support a breach under certain conditions, while physicians remain strongly opposed regardless of the context.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe final conclusion is best stated as follows: French lay people and psychologists find it acceptable to breach confidentiality under certain conditions (particularly when the patient shows a willingness to protect or inform his spouse), whereas physicians are generally opposed to any breach. If one must choose an answer option that best captures this nuance, the correct response is: \u201cAcceptance is conditional among lay people (and psychologists) but is generally rejected by physicians.\u201d \n\nFor the purpose of answer labeling, this conclusion corresponds to answer option C.",

This conclusion matches answer option C as noted.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.",

Understanding the Study Design and Participants  \n\u2022 The study presented 48 different scenarios created from all combinations of five factors:  \n\u2003\u2013 Severity of the disease (severe, lethal)  \n\u2003\u2013 Time available for discussion (little time, much time)  \n\u2003\u2013 Patient\u2019s intent to inform his wife (none, one of these days, immediately)  \n\u2003\u2013 Patient\u2019s intent to adopt protective behaviors (no intent, intent)  \n\u2003\u2013 Decision to consult an STD expert (yes, no)  \n\u2022 Three groups of French participants took part: 144 lay people, 10 psychologists, and 7 physicians.\n\nStep 2. Results: Ratings of Acceptability  \n\u2022 Acceptability of breaching confidentiality was measured on a 0\u201322 scale.  \n\u2003\u2013 Lay people: mean = 11.76  \n\u2003\u2013 Psychologists: mean = 9.28  \n\u2003\u2013 Physicians: mean = 2.90  \n\u2022 This indicates that lay people and psychologists are generally more accepting of breaching confidentiality under certain circumstances, while physicians are much less supportive.\n\nStep 3. Role of Key Factors and Group Heterogeneity  \n\u2022 The greatest influence on acceptability came from whether the patient showed an intent to protect his wife or inform her about the disease.  \n\u2022 A cluster analysis among lay people revealed four distinct patterns:  \n\u20031. Always acceptable  \n\u20032. Acceptable depending on many circumstances  \n\u20033. Acceptable only with expert consultation  \n\u20034. Never acceptable  \n\u2022 Clearly, even within the lay group, there is not a uniform view, and their acceptance is conditional on various factors.\n\nStep 4. Integrating the Findings  \n\u2022 For lay people (and to a somewhat lesser extent, psychologists), the acceptability of breaching confidentiality depends on context. Key conditions include the patient\u2019s intentions regarding his wife\u2019s well\u2010being.  \n\u2022 In contrast, physicians consistently show very low acceptability of breaching confidentiality, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nFinal Answer  \nBased on the above reasoning, the best conclusion is:  \n\u201cFrench lay people and psychologists find breaching confidentiality acceptable\u2014but only under certain conditions (especially when the patient shows a proactive intent to protect or inform his wife), whereas physicians generally reject any breach of confidentiality.\u201d  \n\nFor answer labeling purposes (given the instructions in the original problem), this conclusion corresponds to answer option C.",

        "question": "The aim of this prognostic factor analysis was to investigate if a patient's self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) provided independent prognostic information for survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\nPretreatment HRQOL was measured in 391 advanced NSCLC patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC Lung Cancer module (QLQ-LC13). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for both univariate and multivariate analyses of survival. In addition, a bootstrap validation technique was used to assess the stability of the outcomes.\nThe final multivariate Cox regression model retained four parameters as independent prognostic factors for survival: male gender with a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32 (95% CI 1.03-1.69; P = 0.03); performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) with HR = 1.63 (95% CI 1.04-2.54; P = 0.032); patient's self-reported score of pain with HR= 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.16; P<0.001) and dysphagia with HR = 1.12 (95% CI 1.04-1.21; P = 0.003).

        "question": "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.\nThis was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.\nThe response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006).\nMidwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?",

        "question": "Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.\nOur population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.\nDevelopment of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% confidence interval 0.2-1.1.\nDoes the lipid-lowering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ligand bezafibrate prevent colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease?",

The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion.

Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.

Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.\nNine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant.

Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60\u00a0mm and -0.30\u00a0mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p\u2009=\u20090.02), and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30\u00a0mm. The ICCs were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease.\nThe prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment.\nCoronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other CRFs.

The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.\nA total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively.

In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.\nPopulation-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.\nFrom 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records.

The goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth.\nThis audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance against 4 standards: (1) Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor to all patients; (2) Acceptance and good satisfaction level reported by patients and caregivers. (3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side effects.\nDuring the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p<0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 8.5\u00b11.4 before to 4.1\u00b11.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) VAS decreased from 8.12\u00b11.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76\u00b10.79 after (p<0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after).

Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression.\nOne thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age.

Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection.\nSchanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology (p>0.8).\nIs portable ultrasonography accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments?",

Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ED visit.\nA total of 150 patients were enrolled. The majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p<0.01).

The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS.\nTo receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged \u226565 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged \u226565 years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p<0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education.\nDoes government assistance improve utilization of eye care services by low-income individuals?",

Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used.\nThe sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 \u00b1 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships.

The primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire.\nWe performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (\u226560 years) in Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at \u226575%. Knowledge of stroke and clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression.\nAmong 367 elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%). On average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time. Compared to lower levels of education, higher levels were associated to correctly endorsed intention to call 911 (secondary School adjusted OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86 and Tertiary/University adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.12-8.21).\nDo elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke?",

Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS.

As the burden of long-term chronic HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to research and interventions.\nThis study aimed to compare two samples of gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom burden.\nThe Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this analysis.\nThe Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 0.74).

The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.\nWe reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.\nThirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up.\nTreatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?",

It did so by comparing the prescribed doses to the delivered doses at various PIBS levels (PIBS \u20132, PIBS, PIBS +2).\n\n2. The data showed that the differences between delivered and prescribed doses at the PIBS points were not significant, and the correlation between them was strong (R\u00b2 ranging from 0.93 to 0.95).

        "question": "Anchoring vignettes are brief texts describing a hypothetical character who illustrates a certain fixed level of a trait under evaluation. This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.\nWe investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.\nThe prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity.\nIs adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders?",

Correction for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults.

Primary Endpoint and Outcomes:\n\u2003\u2022 The primary endpoint was the 12\u2011month major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rate, a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target vessel revascularization (TVR).\n\u2003\u2022 In HBR patients:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 MACE occurred in 22.6% of the DES group versus 29% of the BMS group, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.57 to 0.98; p = 0.033).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Myocardial infarctions were reported in 3.5% of DES recipients compared with 10.4% for BMS.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Target vessel revascularization was 5.9% in the DES group versus 11.4% in the BMS group.\n\u2003\u2022 Additionally, the composite of definite or probable stent thrombosis was significantly lower in the DES group.\n\u2003\u2022 Importantly, the rate of bleeding events was comparable between the two groups despite the abbreviated DAPT regimen.\n\n3.

Implications for Clinical Practice:\n\u2003\u2022 The significant reductions in ischemic events (MACE, MI, TVR, and stent thrombosis) with DES, combined with comparable bleeding risks, suggest a clear clinical benefit of using the DES strategy over BMS even in HBR patients.\n\u2003\u2022 Since one of the historical reasons for using BMS was to limit DAPT duration\u2014and thus reduce bleeding risk\u2014the trial\u2019s findings indicate that modern DES with abbreviated DAPT overcomes these concerns without a bleeding penalty.\n\u2003\u2022 As a result, there is little justification to continue using BMS in this population.\n\n4. Final Conclusion:\nBased on the ZEUS trial, using a drug-eluting stent (specifically the zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor Sprint stent) with an abbreviated DAPT regimen leads to superior ischemic outcomes and similar bleeding events when compared with a bare-metal stent. Therefore, the findings indicate that bare-metal stents are no longer justifiable in high bleeding risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\nFinal Answer: DES is preferred over BMS, making the use of bare-metal stents no longer justifiable in this patient population.",

Forty-five patients (36\u00a0%) had undergone c-kit mutation testing. Exon 11 was seen in 25 patients (55.5\u00a0%), 3 with exon 9 (6.7\u00a0%) and 2 with exon 13 (4.4\u00a0%). Twelve were wild type (26.6\u00a0%) and \u00a03 (6.7 %) were declared uninterpretable.

        "question": "To determine the effect of occupational exposure in a nuclear power plant in Griefswald, Germany on male and female fecundity.\nThe frequency of men and women exposed to ionizing radiation through work in a nuclear power plant among 270 infertile couples was retrospectively compared to a control fertile population using a pair-matched analysis. The total cumulative equivalent radiation dose was determined. In addition, the spermiograms of the male partners in both groups were compared and correlated to the degree of exposure.\nNo differences were noted in the frequency of nuclear power plant exposure between sterile and fertile groups. There was a higher rate of anomalous spermiograms in nuclear power plant workers. However, abnormalities were temporary.

        "question": "We investigated the actual role of MRI versus arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee, pain and severe functional impairment. Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography.\nWe retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression.\nWe identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent.\n\"Occult\" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy?",

MRI was a very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.",

In the group without paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group.
