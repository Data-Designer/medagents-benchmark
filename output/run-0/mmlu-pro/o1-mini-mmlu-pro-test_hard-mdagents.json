She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks?\" Options: (F) Transient ischemic attack (D) Cardiac arrhythmia (E) Anxiety (B) Spinal stenosis (G) Adrenal insufficiency (H) Hypoglycemia (C) Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen (A) Side effect of the copper bracelets (I) Atlanto-axial instability",
