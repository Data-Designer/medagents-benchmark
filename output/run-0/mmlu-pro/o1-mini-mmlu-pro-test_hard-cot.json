However, these cases are relatively rare.\n\n2. **Brain pathology (B):** The JC virus, a type of polyomavirus, is linked to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious brain condition, primarily in immunocompromised individuals. While significant, it affects a smaller population.\n\n3. **No disease at all (C):** Many polyomavirus infections are asymptomatic in healthy individuals, meaning they don't cause noticeable disease. However, in immunocompromised people, these viruses can become problematic.\n\n4. **Kidney infections (D):** The BK virus, another polyomavirus, is known to cause kidney infections, especially in transplant patients or those with weakened immune systems. This is a more common clinical concern compared to the other options.\n\nConsidering the prevalence and clinical significance, **kidney infections** caused by the BK virus are the most predominant disease associated with polyomaviruses.\n\n**Answer:** D",

This movement is facilitated by tight junctions, which regulate the passage of water and solutes based on osmotic gradients. The absorption process is largely driven by the active transport of solutes like sodium, which creates an osmotic pull that draws water from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream.",

Historically, there were risks of HIV transmission through plasma-derived products before effective screening and viral inactivation methods were implemented.\n\n2. **Advancements by 2011:** By 2011, significant advancements had been made in the production of factor VIII:\n   - **Recombinant Technology:** Factor VIII began to be produced using recombinant DNA technology, meaning it was synthesized in the lab without relying on human blood plasma. This greatly reduced the risk of blood-borne infections like HIV.\n   - **Enhanced Safety Protocols:** Plasma-derived factor VIII underwent rigorous screening and viral inactivation processes, further minimizing any residual risk.\n\n3. **Eliminating HIV Risk:** The shift to recombinant (synthetically made) factor VIII was a pivotal factor in eliminating the risk of HIV transmission, as it no longer depended on human donors who could potentially carry the virus.\n\n**Answer:**  \n**H**",

        "raw_response": "The lac operon in *E. coli* is regulated by a repressor protein that binds to the operator region to inhibit transcription in the absence of lactose. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator, thereby allowing gene expression.\n\nIn this scenario, a mutation occurs in the repressor that prevents it from binding to lactose. As a result, the repressor cannot be inactivated by lactose and remains bound to the operator regardless of the presence of lactose. Consequently, the lac operon remains repressed under all conditions, leading to a lack or significant reduction in the expression of the lac operon genes.\n\n**Answer:** I",
        "thinking": "Given that a mutation in the repressor prevents it from binding to lactose, the operon will remain repressed at all times regardless of lactose presence, which leads to reduced expression of the lac operon genes.",

This is **correct**. The TMJ contains a fibrocartilaginous disc that allows for smooth movement and absorbs shock.\n   - **Option (I)** incorrectly states that the articular disc is made of hyaline cartilage, which is not true.\n\n2. **Proprioceptive Information:**\n   - **Option (D)** correctly identifies that proprioceptive information is carried by the masseteric and auriculotemporal nerves, which are branches of the trigeminal nerve.\n   - **Options (B), (E), (H)** incorrectly associate proprioception with other nerves not primarily involved in TMJ proprioception.\n\n3. **Joint Type and Articular Surfaces:**\n   - **Option (C)** suggests the TMJ is a hinge joint, which is partially true, but the TMJ is actually a ginglymoarthrodial joint, allowing both hinge and sliding movements.\n   - **Option (F)** correctly states that the articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage, but this is only partially true as the disc itself is fibrocartilage.\n   - **Options (G), (J)** are incorrect regarding the type of cartilage and joint classification.\n\nGiven that multiple options contain correct information, but **Option (A)** directly addresses a fundamental characteristic of the TMJ, it is the most accurate choice.\n\n**Answer:** A",

Carrier females often have elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels due to muscle cell damage from random X chromosome inactivation (lyonization). In this case:\n\n- **Family History:** The patient's brother and maternal uncle had DMD, suggesting that the maternal side carries the mutation.\n- **Mother's CK Levels:** The mother has elevated CK levels (300 U/L), indicating she is likely a carrier.\n- **Patient's CK Levels:** The patient has a normal CK level (120 U/L). However, normal CK levels do not rule out carrier status because of potential random X inactivation, where the non-mutated X chromosome may be predominantly active, masking the carrier status.\n\nTherefore, without genetic analysis, the patient's carrier status remains uncertain due to the possibility of random X inactivation affecting CK levels.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**I**",
